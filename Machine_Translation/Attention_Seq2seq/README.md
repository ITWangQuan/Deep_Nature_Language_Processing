Tensorflow implementation of Attention+Seq2Seq Model.
'decoder_train' and 'encoder_train' contains the processed index of Chinese and English sentence.
Because the processed files are very large, only one split file is uploaded for each as insight.
The original data set will be shared later.

**Requirements:**  

* Python 3  
* TensorFlow >= 1.4  


**How to run:**  
  ```
  python prepare_data2.py
  python train.py --mode train
  ```
