CONTENT:  ['David Page didn\'t quite bring pizza to the UK, but he did play a crucial role in making Pizza Express one of the country\'s most popular places to eat in the 1980s and 90s.But his journey to becoming boss of the famous pizza chain - and owner of other restaurant groups such as Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Franco Manca - was far from conventional, and characterised by a penchant for doing things his own way.Now 65 years old, the serial restaurateur recalls a time when, in the mid-80s, he went to ask for a £2m business loan, only to be met with incredulity from his bank manger because he was wearing slipper-like espadrilles."I wasn\'t wearing any socks either!", the Londoner says with a chuckle. "He couldn\'t quite believe it, but he still lent me the money."As a younger man, few would have guessed that David would go on to run some of the UK\'s best-known restaurant chains.In 1969 he was expelled from his Jesuit-run secondary school Wimbledon College in southwest London, for what he politely describes as "truancy".David then tried to become a cartographer at the Ordnance Survey, the UK\'s mapping agency, but his refusal to cut his hair or wear a tie resulted in another parting of the ways.Next he began training to become a teacher, and washed dishes at his local Pizza Express in south London to make ends meet. The first Pizza Express had opened in central London in 1965, and by the early 1970s it had a handful of branches across the capital.David says he soon realised that working in the restaurant industry was his true calling, and when the opportunity to become a Pizza Express branch manager arose he soon ditched the classroom.By 1981 he had bought the franchise to operate a Pizza Express in Chiswick, west London."If you fancied learning how to become a capitalist you became a franchisee," says David, who took out a second mortgage to fund that investment."I didn\'t know what a capitalist was - my parents were socialists, so capitalism was a very dirty word."David, who went on to open many more franchises over the next decade, says Pizza Express was "pioneering" in the 1980s, and a breath of fresh air in England\'s then rather bland food scene.He even recalls getting a letter from an "unbelievably delighted customer" in Banstead, Surrey, who proclaimed the opening of the town\'s Pizza Express was the most exciting thing to happen there since the library was bombed in 1942. By the time Pizza Express was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1993, David and three business partners had 25 franchises that formed the biggest part of the newly-listed company.Despite claiming not to have known what a balance sheet was back then, David became chief executive and later chairman, during which time Pizza Express grew to about 300 outlets - mostly in the UK, but a few in other countries, such as the US, as well.The chain was then sold in 2003 to a number of private equity firms for £278m. Today Pizza Express is owned by China\'s Hony Capital, and has branches in 11 countries.After leaving Pizza Express David went on to co-found restaurant parent group Clapham House, whose chains included Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Bombay Bicycle Club and Tootsies.Another decent payday came in 2010 when Clapham House was bought by South African chilli chicken chain Nandos for £30m.But rather than take early retirement, the then 58-year-old David started looking for the next restaurant opportunity.His attention was drawn to a small artisan pizza shop called Franco Manca that had opened in Brixton, south London, in 2009.With customers queuing around the block for its wood fired and sourdough pizzas, David says that he and his team were "fans of the concept from day one".They soon invested in Franco Manca to help it expand, and in 2015 David\'s new investment group Fulham Shore bought a majority stake for £27.5m.There are now 40 Franco Manca outlets, mostly in London. David personally designs each restaurant, keeping the sites compact to ensure no space is wasted.But things haven\'t all gone according to plan for the restaurateur, whose Fulham Shore also owns the Real Greek restaurants.He says he has passed up on countless opportunities to invest in successful ventures, including Krispy Kreme donuts, the Caffe Nero coffee shop chain, and food delivery business Deliveroo - which he decided "would never work".David also says that Brexit - the UK\'s decision and continuing path towards leaving the European Union - was a "major disruption" to both Franco Manca and the Real Greek, and the UK\'s restaurant sector in general.More  features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world:He says this is because the weaker pound has pushed up raw material prices, and fewer Europeans are coming to the UK, making it harder to recruit staff.In addition David says that the wider public are now going out for fewer meals as UK economic growth has slowed. Back in September Fulham Shore issued a profit warning and said it was putting the brakes on expansion plans.Roger Tejwani, a restaurant sector analyst at stockbrokers Finncap, says that the current trading environment is "tough" for firms like Fulham Shore.However, he adds that he is confident of the group\'s longer-term prospects, partly because it has such an experienced management team who have all "seen this movie several times before".When asked if there is a secret to his success, David answers: "It\'s not just me." Instead he has worked with the same team for the past two decades and says it\'s "one big happy family really".While Franco Manca may never have quite the global reach of Pizza Express, which its new owners hope will turn China onto pizza, he thinks it has potential beyond the UK.In a case of coals to Newcastle, the chain already has a summer outpost on the Italian island of Salina, north of Sicily, where founder Giuseppe Mascoli has a house.As David says: "Everybody loves pizza, all around the world."']	 CATEGORY:Business

CONTENT:  ['A project to get more disadvantaged youngsters in the UK to apply to leading universities is being applied to schools in South Africa\'s townships.The  is an award-winning scheme that puts PhD students into schools in the UK, with the aim of teaching new skills, raising aspirations and making university seem a more attainable goal.In South Africa, operating as AccessEd, it has completed a pilot year in 16 schools and two youth centres, with pupils aged about 13 to 15.In the UK, the big divide in access to university is social background. Young people from wealthy families are much more likely to go to university than poorer youngsters.This is also the case in South Africa - but with the big overlaying factor of race casting a post-apartheid shadow.The university access rate for white teenagers is over 40%, for their black counterparts it is below 10%.Programme director Rajbir Hazelwood says that as well as academic challenges, there are some big practical difficulties to overcome.In townships such as Philippi in Cape Town and Alexandra in Johannesburg, the problems can be about the lack of basic infrastructure and "classrooms fit for purpose". In Philippi, she says: "The majority of our pupils had no access to ICT [information and communications technology]."With basic needs not met, these under-resourced schools face an upward struggle in supporting their pupils in the matriculation exams which allow you to go to university in South Africa." Ms Hazelwood adds that university dropout rates are very high in South Africa, as much as 40%.While the focus of the project in the UK is giving young people the confidence to apply, in South Africa they have to give their students the "academic and social skills" needed to complete their degrees.But in both the UK and in South Africa, a key part of this project has been to give disadvantaged youngsters a sense of intellectual challenge, inspiring them to think beyond their immediate horizons.The postgraduate students working with the project run tutorials and teach university-style courses, with assignments and marking.In South Africa, for those who successfully finish the programme, the graduation event is to go to a university and  see, perhaps for the first time, what it\'s like to be a student and to show that it\'s an accessible target.It\'s a chance for the university too to talk to young people about how they might take the next steps and what they will need to get on to a degree course.University access in South Africa is also highly political, with protests that poor, black youngsters are still not getting their fair chances, either through cost or inadequacies in their school-level education.Last month, responding to such dissatisfaction, the president, Jacob Zuma, promised free higher education for poorer students, with grants covering fees to be phased in from this year.But this has raised questions about whether the university system has the capacity for many more students and how this will be delivered.Although continents apart, the projects in the UK and South Africa both reflect the significance of getting young people into university."Graduates have better employment prospects and earning power, better health and wellbeing and better civic engagement," says the impact report on AccessEd\'s pilot phase.But access to becoming a graduate remains deeply unequal.More from Ideas for the ?

CONTENT:  ['When a 22-year-old Melanie Perkins nervously pitched her start-up idea to a Silicon Valley multi-millionaire she followed a novel if somewhat risky tactic.The university drop-out had flown all the way from her home in Perth, Australia, to Palo Alto, California, for the meeting with well-known technology investor Bill Tai.Melanie had read that if you wanted to impress someone you should mimic their body language. So seeking backing for her graphic design website she decided to put the theory to the test."It was pretty funny," says Melanie, who is now 30. "He was sitting there with his arm behind his chair, eating his lunch."So I\'m there with my arm behind my chair, trying to eat my lunch, while flipping the pages of my pitch... to sell him on the future of publishing."Melanie\'s idea for the "future of publishing" is Canva, an online platform that aims to allow anyone to easily design everything from greetings cards to posters, and websites to calendars.But while Mr Tai didn\'t seem to notice that Melanie was copying his movements, he also didn\'t appear to be that interested in her business idea."I didn\'t think he was liking my pitch at all because he was on his phone the whole time," she says.Mr Tai was, however, impressed enough to introduce Melanie to a network of other Silicon Valley investors, engineers and developers. And he ultimately invested in Canva himself.Today Melanie\'s Sydney-based business The company has 10 million users across 179 countries, and 10 designs are created via its website every second. Not bad for a business that had its genesis in the lounge of Melanie\'s mother\'s house in Perth.This was back in 2006 when Melanie was a 19-year-old commerce and communications student at the University of Western Australia. At the time she says she was frustrated by how long it took to learn how to use most mainstream design software."It could take a whole semester to learn the very basics," she says. "Even the simplest tasks, like exporting a high-quality PDF file, could take 22 clicks."While most of us would moan about this state of affairs, and then give it no more thought, Melanie spotted a business opportunity.She decided to try to launch an online design website that would be as easy as possible for people to use."I realised that in the future design was all going to be online and collaborative, and much, much simpler."Deciding to test her business idea in the relatively small scale world of school yearbooks, she and her boyfriend Chris Obrecht founded Fusion Books, a website that allows high schools to design their yearbooks online.Effectively a prototype version of what would become the Canva system, she and Chris set up shop in her mother\'s front room, and borrowed money from relatives to pay for software designers to build the platform. Over the next few years, Fusion grew into Australia\'s largest yearbook publisher, before expanding to France and New Zealand. The business was so successful that Melanie decided to leave university to focus on it full-time.Realising that Fusion could be applied beyond yearbooks, it was in 2010 that she flew to California to pitch the idea for Canva to potential investors, including the fateful meeting with Mr Tai.Melanie says that Silicon Valley was a big culture shock, due to what she says is the vast difference between Australian and American attitudes to self promotion."In Australia, people really talk down their accomplishments," she says. "In Silicon Valley, where you\'re trying to raise funds or get an engineering team, you have to actually be able to speak about your accomplishments."Perhaps in part due to this cultural clash, it took Melanie three years before she got any investment from Silicon Valley. But in 2013 Canva was launched, backed by $3m, and with former Google executive Cameron Adams joining Melanie and her boyfriend Chris as a co-founder.Melanie says it was worth the wait."It was three years between first pitching to an investor and actually landing investment," she says. "This is an incredibly long period of time, and we had hundreds of rejections along the way."But I think that process was really helpful for us, because it meant that we had to refine our pitch, and really get our strategy down before we started. So when we landed that investment we were able to execute quite quickly and effectively."Subsequent rounds of investment have seen Canva raise $82m in total. While the website\'s basic service is free to use, it makes its money by charging a subscription fee to access its more advanced tools.Today, more than 200 people work for Canva, which has headquarters in Sydney and Manila, and an office in San Francisco.In the financial year 2016-17 Canva\'s revenues grew more than twofold from $6.8m to $23.5m,  However, the company made a loss of $3.3m, and has actually not yet made a profit as it has instead focused on rapid expansion.Canva is a private company, so  That\'s what they think the firm - and Melanie and her team - are worth.Melanie remains in the main chief executive role, and Chris - who is still her boyfriend - is the chief operating officer. The couple also still own Fusion Books, but have appointed a team of managers to run that business.Danielle Logue, an associate professor at Sydney\'s UTS Business School, says that the key issue for Melanie - or the boss of any growing start-up company - is the importance of being able to delegate."Having the right people in, recruiting the right people [is crucial], because you can\'t have bottlenecks in decision making, and having it all left up to the founder to make these decisions," says Ms Logue."And that is a real challenge for founders sometimes - letting go of their baby."Melanie says that most of Canva\'s growth has come from positive world of mouth, and she has big ambitions for the company to continue to expand."Our goal is to enable the whole world to design," she says.']	 CATEGORY:Business 

CONTENT:  ['Charging extra to anyone using a credit or debit card will be banned in the UK from Saturday, 13 January. This will mean an end to the extra cost added on at the end of the process of buying something online, such as a flight ticket, or being hit with a surcharge when using a card in a small shop. However, the change may mean a rise in prices and there are questions over how it will be policed.The travel industry prompted the most anger from customers for adding on card surcharges to the headline price, according to James Daley, founder of Fairer Finance.Mr Daley was instrumental in an official  about excessive card charges in 2011 when at consumer association Which?. He says that, back then, a family of four could be hit with a surcharge of £48 simply for paying for a return flight on a credit or debit card.This far outweighed the cost of processing the payment, just a few pence in the case of debit cards.Take-away food apps, ticket booking sites and even government departments have all demanded extra for paying by card.In 2012, businesses were told these surcharges could only reflect the extra costs they faced for processing these payments. This led to some grey areas, was poorly policed and, at times, ignored.Now, the new ban covers card surcharges of any amount. Probably. Businesses still face the cost of accepting cards, although it is cheaper than it used to be.As a result they may add this cost into their headline price.Campaigners such as Mr Daley argue that this will still be much better for customers. It will make it easier to compare total prices when looking for the cheapest deal.No. Extra fees that have nothing to do with the way you pay can still be charged. So, for example, a cinema or theatre can still charge a booking fee and an airline can charge for choosing a seat.There has already been  on all orders made with takeaway food app (and FTSE 100 company) Just Eat.This charge of 50p is the same amount as the card payment surcharge that it has withdrawn.Money experts say it is wrong to rebrand credit card fees as a service charge. Just Eat said it had already been considering changes to its charges but that "the change to legislation did play a part in prompting the review".Any business is within its rights to refuse a method of payment. The question is whether this will affect their custom by doing so, especially as the use of non-cash payments is growing fast.Some pubs and small shops already say they will only accept a card when the customer spends more than £5 or £10, and they can continue to do so.One major organisation that will no longer accept credit card payments after 13 January is HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).The UK\'s tax authority says there were 454,000 cases of people in the self-assessment system settling their tax bill by credit card in 2016-17. It has been charging up to 0.6% for payment by credit card, and says it would be unfair to expect other taxpayers to pick up the cost.Trading standards officers are supposed to police the system, and consumer groups have called on them to ensure businesses do not find a way around it.However, the organisation that represents trading standards officers says that these departments, based in local authorities, have seen their numbers and funding cut in recent years.As a result, checking up on card surcharges is "unlikely to be a priority" for local trading standards teams, it says. The UK rules are an extension of European rules under the second Payment Services Directive, to be precise.Having been written into UK law, they will continue after the UK leaves the EU in 2019.']	 CATEGORY:Business 

CONTENT:  ['Shares in photo firm Eastman Kodak soared nearly 120% after it revealed plans to mint its own crypto-currency, the KodakCoin.The US firm said it was teaming up with London-based Wenn Media Group to carry out the initial coin offering (ICO).It is part  to help photographers control their image rights.Kodak also detailed plans to install rows of Bitcoin mining rigs at its headquarters in Rochester, New York.Details of this second scheme - which is being branded the Kodak KashMiner - were outlined at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.Customers will pay up-front to rent mining capacity.Kodak is the latest in a series of companies to see its value jump after revealing plans for blockchain-related activity."This is a phenomenon we saw back during the dot com days in the late 1990s where traditional companies would mention some kind of internet strategy and their stock price would jump up," commented Garrick Hileman from the University of Cambridge."When you see stock prices moving like this it does appear to be troubling - it\'s hard to say if there\'s a bubble but it certainly is indicative of a frothy investment market."Kodak was famously slow to join the digital revolution, and its hesitation to leave behind its film heritage cost the company its market.Since its collapse in 2012, Kodak has licensed its brand to a variety of manufacturers, with the mark appearing on batteries, printers, drones, tablet computers and digital cameras.The KashMiner operation will be run by Spotlite, a licensee that had previously teamed up with Kodak to use its brand to market LED lights.Mining involves carrying out processor-intensive tasks to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to verify crypto-currency transactions.Any Bitcoins generated by Kodak KashMiner will be shared between the customer and the business.Each of the mining rig boxes - which include computer processors and fans to keep them cool - will use about the same amount of electricity as running a hairdryer around the clock. But the scheme will be able to take advantage of Kodak\'s on-site power generating plant, which has had spare capacity since Kodak\'s heyday. The company says it can power each rig for four cents per kilowatt hour, which is significantly cheaper than running a rig at home.At Bitcoin\'s current value, an up-front investment of $4,000 (£2,954) for 24 months of mining could earn a profit of $500 a month, Spotlite\'s Halston Mikail told the BBC.But anybody hoping to join the gamble would have to wait, as capacity is already sold out, Mr Mikail added."At this time we have 80 miners, and we expect another 300 to arrive shortly. There is a big pile-up of demand," he said.Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and some analysts fear its value could crash, resulting in a loss for those who had paid up-front for mining capacity.But Mr Mikail said the rigs could be put to work on other tasks if Bitcoin faltered."Bitcoin could be a bubble. But the blockchain industry is not a bubble," he said."It\'s a solid platform built on mathematics and it will survive."Kodak\'s other initiative, the KodakCoin, is being created as part of an effort to build a global ledger of picture rights ownership that photographers can add their work to.Associated KodakOne software will be used to crawl the web and find pictures that have been used without permission. The company said it would then "manage the licensing process," so the photographer can be paid, in KodakCoin."Kodak has always sought to democratise photography and make licensing fair to artists," said Kodak chief executive Jeff Clarke."These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that."The company\'s shares traded more than 130% above their opening price after the announcement before closing the day 119.4% higher.But one expert had doubts."Storing the information in a blockchain doesn\'t protect your copyright any more than copyright law already does," commented David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50ft Blockchain."Notice how they\'re marketing it: they state a problem, then say the blockchain can solve it. But there\'s no mechanism by which the blockchain could do that."This doesn\'t do anything that signing up for Shutterstock or Getty Images wouldn\'t."Even so, some think Kodak will not be the last household name to associate itself with an ICO."I expect we are going to see more major brands releasing their own tokens and currencies to support various products and services," commented Mr Hileman."It\'s something many big companies are thinking very hard about."']	 CATEGORY:Business

CONTENT:  ['January is a peak time for downloading health and fitness apps and putting those Christmas present fitness trackers to work. But do they actually help you stay motivated?After the Christmas self-indulgence comes the inevitable New Year\'s resolution to get fit, lose weight, and eat more healthily. But while 65% of us make resolutions, only 12% successfully keep to them, polling firm ComRes finds. Can tech help?When Sarah, 34, a law professor from Australia, wanted to lose weight last year, she took the unusual approach of placing bets that she would achieve her exercise goals. Breast cancer had stopped her exercise routine, and she\'d gained weight during a year which included three operations, she says."I was returning to exercise by hiking and trying to lose some of the weight I\'d put on while being sedentary," she says.She began a new exercise routine eight weeks after finishing breast reconstruction surgery. With a wearable activity tracker, she monitored the steps she took each day and the calories she burned.But she also motivated herself with an app, Step Bet, that let her wager whether she would achieve her exercise goals."I did three one-month bets and three six-month bets, and lost 7kg [15 lbs] - 10% of my body weight," says Sarah.She also says she made £358 [$458; €403].  "I like losing fat. I don\'t like losing money. The effect? Motivation!" she explains.For the data-minded, tracking your progress with reams of measurements is enough to stay motivated.Arshia Gratiot, who is 40 and originally from Bangalore, has been using a fitness tracker for a year, "to measure biometrics such as my heart rate, associated with my level of fitness," she says.In 2016, she founded a technology start-up with offices in Finland, India, and London. Frequently travelling across time zones made her decide to go running each evening - sometimes in the middle of the night - while listening to podcasts.  "It was either lie in bed like a zombie, totally jet-lagged, or hit the road.  It was the only way I could stay sane," she says.Tracking her heart rate and metabolism offered "a visual way to track progress over time" and encouraged her, says Ms Gratiot.But it\'s how we use such data that matters, argues Anil Aswani, an assistant professor in industrial engineering and operations research at the University of California, Berkeley."Personalized goal setting is a very important aspect of these apps," he says The better exercise apps learn from how you\'ve done in the past to tailor your goals, he argues. And doing this builds a sense of achievement, which behavioural psychologists say is important in altering your habits."If you\'re effective at meeting goals today, it boosts your confidence and makes you more likely to meet your goals in the future," says Prof Aswani.In his own research, one group of test subjects was given a changing number of steps as a goal each day, based on their previous progress. Another was assigned the same number of steps every day.The group given adaptive goals averaged about 1,000m more each day, he says.Joseph Laws, a former US army Ranger who served in Afghanistan and afterwards worked as a software engineer at Google, has developed his own way of setting adaptive goals. Based on his army experience, he began developing fitness routines for friends and family. Later, he started developing machine learning algorithms to find out which exercises best built fitness, based on age, sex, height, and weight.Mr Laws released the official version of his app, Optimize, six months ago.The challenge was "developing a model of fitness, and mapping those equations to actual exercises," he says. Once he had the model in place, his algorithms could learn and improve each time a person exercised. The workouts would then adapt to the person\'s past performance.Around 90% of users who make it to their fourth workout continue to use it for the next two months, he says. Most of the data comes from people "20 to 50 years old", he says, so the next challenge is gathering more data from older exercisers, and other non-typical groups, such as people with injuries.Other fitness start-ups are trying to apply machine learning to calorie counting.Charles Teague\'s app, Lose It!, began by asking users to log everything they ate, then keeping track of their calories and nutrients, he says.This, as everyone knows who\'s tried it, is a bit of a faff."So wouldn\'t it be great if you could just take a picture of your food, and it was just logged?" he asks.A year ago, he introduced a feature called Snap It, which is learning how to identify food on a plate. "The data we\'ve accumulated today would do things like recognise that\'s pasta, that\'s an apple, that\'s a banana," says Mr Teague.But more data is needed if the app is to discern spaghetti bolognese from fettuccine alfredo, for example.At the moment, users train the algorithm as they use it, by selecting the precise type of food in front of them from options the algorithm identifies. So it will take time before the app becomes sufficiently clever to recognise most food variants.With the World Health Organisation saying obesity is now more common than under-nutrition, researchers agree apps based on health and psychological research have the potential to transform how we eat and exercise.But of 29,000 apps relating to weight loss and fitness, only 17 were based on verifiable scientific research, a 2016 study at the Catholic University of Louvain found.Despite this, the global mobile fitness app market grew from $1.8bn in 2016 to $2.2bn, says research firm Statista, while the fitness wearables market was worth $6.1bn in 2017, a figure expected to reach $7.5bn by 2022.So as well as thinking about what you eat and how far you run, it\'s worth checking out the credentials of the fitness app or tracker first before committing your hard-earned cash.What works for you will depend largely on your personality and what pushes your motivational buttons.']	 CATEGORY:Business

CONTENT:  ['Carrie Gracie\'s resignation as the BBC\'s China Editor has highlighted the issue of equal pay and it got us wondering how widespread the problem is in the UK.Equal pay means staff doing the same job must be paid the same amount - it is a legal requirement. Remember that having equal pay does not necessarily mean that you do not have a gender pay gap. The BBC reported in October that its gender pay gap was 9.3%, but that may be because more men are in senior jobs than women.The chart above shows the number of cases about equal pay in employment tribunals that have reached conclusions.What it does not show is the outcome of those cases.  for the outcomes, but they are not as much help as you might expect.Since 2011, so few cases were successful at a hearing they were recorded as 0%. But, on the flipside, the proportion of cases recorded as unsuccessful at a hearing was also 0%.So what is going on?A large proportion of cases are "dismissed upon withdrawal", in other words the employee and employer either came to a conclusion away from the tribunal or the employee withdrew, and in those circumstances the results are not made public.So we don\'t know how often genuine cases of unequal pay occur.No other area of complaint has this feature at tribunals - discrimination on the grounds of age or race or disability all have at least a small proportion of cases decided one way or the other by the tribunal.It turns out that demonstrating that jobs are equal is such a difficult and drawn-out process that very few cases are ever decided at tribunal level."The procedures that have to be followed in equal pay cases are so complicated that people settle," said Caroline Underhill from Thompsons Solicitors."For all other claims the legal procedures are far less convoluted and the law is easier to understand."It also means that cases which do proceed to tribunal can drag on."Equal pay cases are notorious for taking a long time... making the cases expensive", according to the TUC.As we see in the chart at the beginning of this article there is no clear pattern in the numbers of equal pay cases being heard in tribunals.And it is particularly difficult to read anything into it because of the impact of charging people who brought cases. There was a big fall in the number of all types of cases going to tribunals when fees were introduced in July 2013.The numbers went up again after July 2017,  by the courts to stop charging fees.

Food prices have gone up, as the drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote made imports more expensive."We\'ve done everything we can as a business to mitigate that but we can\'t get away from the fact that food prices are going up," Mr Coupe told the BBC.But with that effect wearing off, food price inflation should "gradually reduce over the next six to nine months", he said.Sainsbury\'s, which also owns Argos,  in the last three months, as higher grocery sales made up for a 1.4% fall in general merchandise and slower clothing sales.Argos\'s Fast Track delivery and collection grew strongly over the period, but that was not enough to stop a slide in Argos\'s sales."The general merchandise that Argos sells may be a millstone around the group\'s neck right now, but longer term the appeal of combining Christmas grocery and gift shopping in one location is clear to see," said Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.The supermarket said it had "record" sales over Christmas, as discounted turkeys and other trimmings brought in more shoppers.Sainsbury\'s now expects pre-tax profits to be slightly higher than the previous estimate of £559m, helped by higher cost savings from its takeover of Argos.The company also said it would save an extra £40m as part of a £500m cost-cutting drive that includes .']	 CATEGORY:Business

It\'s the sixth consecutive year of growth for the industry, British Marine said."These impressive figures demonstrate how the industry has successfully cashed in on the pound\'s devaluation since the Brexit referendum in 2016," said Howard Pridding, chief executive of British Marine.Revenues last reached £3.1bn in 2008-09 as recession gripped the world\'s major economies. The fall in the value of the pound has also helped the domestic market as holiday-makers decided to stay in the UK.Examining the trends over the second half of last year British Marine said 60% of the industry\'s tourism specialists reported an increase in sales over the summer.

CONTENT:  ['Carphone Warehouse has been fined £400,000 by the Information Commissioner\'s Office (ICO) after a data breach in 2015. to the personal data of more than three million customers and 1,000 employees during a cyber-attack.The fine is one of the largest ever issued by the ICO.The retailer said it accepts the ICO\'s findings and apologised for any distress it "may have caused".The data breach affected Carphone Warehouse\'s online division, which operated the OneStopPhoneShop.com, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk websites.The compromised customer data included names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, marital status and, for more than 18,000 customers, historical payment card details.The records for some Carphone Warehouse employees, including names, phone numbers, postcodes, and car registrations were also accessed.The Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: "A company as large, well-resourced, and established as Carphone Warehouse, should have been actively assessing its data security systems, and ensuring systems were robust and not vulnerable to such attacks."Carphone Warehouse should be at the top of its game when it comes to cyber-security, and it is concerning that the systemic failures we found related to rudimentary, commonplace measures."The final cost of the fine is expected to be £320,000, as the ICO offers a 20% discount on penalties that are paid less than a month after being issued. The hackers, using valid login credentials, were able to access the computer system using an out-of-date WordPress software.Affected customers and employees were informed at the time. Carphone Warehouse and the ICO have found no evidence of fraud or identity theft from the data breach.A statement from the company said: "As the ICO notes in its report, we moved quickly at the time to secure our systems, to put in place additional security measures and to inform the ICO and potentially affected customers and colleagues."Since the attack in 2015 we have worked extensively with cyber security experts to improve and upgrade our security systems and processes. "We are very sorry for any distress or inconvenience the incident may have caused."']	 CATEGORY:Business

Unlike British supermarkets, the German company does not publish like-for-like sales figures for the UK which strip out the impact of new store openings. So, the sales growth would have been helped by its expansion since December 2016. ']	 CATEGORY:Business 

CONTENT:  ['The former boss of BHS has accused the pension regulator of a "hostile and deliberate" act by launching an investigation just days after his takeover, a court has heard.Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS for £1 from Sir Philip Green, said the investigation had weighed on the firm.The Pensions Regulator alleges that Mr Chappell failed to provide information three times about the collapsed department store\'s pension schemes.Mr Chappell denies the charges. BHS collapsed in April 2016 under Mr Chappell\'s ownership, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a £571m pensions deficit. Giving evidence at Brighton Magistrates\' Court, the businessman said the regulator had taken an aggressive stance against BHS since he took over.He was handed a section 72 notice - a request to provide information to the regulator - 16 days after he took over the struggling retailer in March 2015, the court heard.Mr Chappell, a former bankrupt, said of the notice: "We found it an outrageous act that was served when we had given the pension regulator every courtesy."It was a hostile and deliberate act and it fundamentally affected our business."The notice was a "powerful document resting on the back of the company", as it signalled an investigation into wrongdoing, he told the court.Three separate section 72 notices, served in April and May 2016 and a third time in February 2017, form the basis of the charges against him.Mr Chappell claims he was locked out of the BHS offices when it went into administration, which prevented him from accessing the relevant documents.Sir Philip later agreed to shore up the BHS pension schemes with an extra £360m, but the regulator continues to investigate whether Mr Chappell should make a contribution as well.Mr Chappell bought BHS in March 2015 through his business Retail Acquisitions (RAL). He received £2.5m in payments from the company in his year of ownership.']	 CATEGORY:Business

CONTENT:  ['UK manufacturing output is expanding at its fastest rate since early 2008 after recording a seventh consecutive month of growth in November.Renewable energy projects, boats, aeroplanes and cars for export helped make output 3.9% higher in the three months to November than in 2016.by 0.4% in November.Construction output in the three months to November fell by 2%, compared with the previous three months.That was the industry\'s biggest quarterly fall since August 2012, with the only bright spot for the sector being a 1.2% increase in new housing.For the month of November, total production was estimated to have increased by 0.4% compared with the previous month, with the biggest contribution coming from energy supply.This increased by 3.2%, mainly because the temperature was warmer than average in October, but colder than average in November.Economic growth had slowed in the first nine months of 2017 with higher inflation caused by the fall in sterling after the Brexit referendum, although the UK economy did grow by 0.4% in the three months to September.While the manufacturing figures are good, it is important to note that the sector only makes up roughly 10% of the economy.British manufacturing is riding high on two big trends - a weaker currency and global growth.Sterling\'s fall in value following the Brexit referendum has made UK exports more competitive.And for the first time since the financial crisis,  the three main engines of global growth - the USA, China and Europe - are performing strongly at the same time.That has led to car exports, for example, rising rapidly - contributing to a narrowing of the trade deficit with the rest of the world.That\'s the difference in value between what we import and what we export.Domestically, the economic picture is more subdued, with growth still sluggish.The weak construction figures are testament to that.But, helped by that positive world outlook, Britain\'s manufacturing sector has not seen such quarterly buoyancy since April 2008.And it is enjoying its strongest run of growth since 1997.Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers\' organisation EEF, said: "UK manufacturers were, in the main, in good shape as 2017 came to a close, with the majority of sub-sectors enjoying growth.  "Manufacturers\' expectations for the year ahead point to output and export growth being maintained through this year on the back of continuing support from a burgeoning global economy."This, together with an ongoing commitment from government to deliver on its industrial strategy, will be crucial in helping to propel the sector forward," she said.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: "The downturn in construction activity has been driven by new work in the private commercial sector, which was 5.4% lower in the three months to November than in the previous three months. "Looking ahead, Brexit uncertainty is likely to continue to hit commercial projects, while the planned 4.5% decline in public sector investment in 2018/19 will additionally dampen the sector."']	 CATEGORY:Business

CONTENT:  ['The sight of hard-shelled coconuts wrapped in a plastic-style film has left shoppers scratching their heads.For some, it is another example of pointless packaging, which is adding to the piles of plastic waste.The boss of Sainsbury\'s, one of the supermarkets selling the £3 ready-to-drink coconuts, agreed in a BBC interview that it seemed "daft".But the coconuts\' supplier says the film is fully recyclable and keeps the water fresh for much longer.The Genuine Coconut company says the film is not a standard plastic and is made from recycled materials.It comes just a day after similar questions were raised about  and sold by Marks and Spencer in plastic wrapping.So has our food supply gone coco-nuts, or does the packaging help prevent another problem: food waste?The "Genuine Coconut" is wrapped in film, and comes with a pull top and straw to drink the coconut water. It is also sold by Waitrose, Marks and Spencer and Ocado, and compares with a normal coconut that sells at about 80p.  The supplier of the coconuts - which come from Thailand - says the film helps to give them a longer shelf life of 40 days without using chemicals. But one customer asked: "Was a coconut shell not good enough protection?"Another Twitter user, Alex Morss, a blogger and ecologist, said: "This coconut is not sold in its natural container, without processing, as nature intended... Plastic wrap/straws are not natural, sustainable or biodegradable."Asked about the coconut controversy, Sainsbury\'s chief executive, Mike Coupe, told the BBC he\'ll "certainly be asking some questions about why we wrap coconuts in plastic".But he also said it is important to remember that packaging helps to protect some products. "It does play a part in making sure we don\'t increase the food waste in our business as well, so there\'s always a trade-off to be made," Mr Coupe said.The , according to trade organisation Plastics Europe, and recent changes in China have made it more difficult to process. Ministers are trying to tackle waste by making it simpler for people to recycle and by  to all retailers.Some shops are already taking steps to reduce plastic waste. For example, Sainsbury\'s says it has reduced its packaging by 30% over the last five years. In the US, pre-peeled mandarins in plastic packaging were  after a customer\'s photo and tweet went viral.But the Spanish company behind Genuine Coconut says the wrapping is specially designed and can be recycled. It is an "anti-steam film" that is recyclable and prevents the water inside the coconut from spoiling and evaporating. This replicates the coconut\'s original green coating, the company says, and so helps it to stay fresh for longer without preservatives and chemicals.Without the film, the coconuts could not be classed as organic, the company adds.A Sainsbury\'s spokeswoman said the supermarket had no plans to review the availability of a product that is "organic and comes in packaging that is fully recyclable".']	 CATEGORY:Business

CONTENT:  ['Canada has filed an expansive complaint with the World Trade Organization, accusing the US of breaking international trade rules.The complaint challenges the ways the US investigates products for subsidies and below-cost sales in the US.The US called the claims "unfounded".The action comes amid disputes between the two countries over issues such as dairy, aircraft sales and lumber as well as tense efforts to renegotiate the North American free trade deal.Canada\'s  cites US investigations of products from countries around the world, with decisions that date back to 1996. Among other charges, Canada says the US improperly calculates rates and restricts parties from presenting evidence to defend themselves, with a cut-off for supplying information that comes too early in the process.It also accuses the US International Trade Commission of being biased, since disputes over which the body\'s six commissioners are evenly divided automatically result in a finding.The complaint targets a process that the US has deployed frequently under President Donald Trump, who has embraced a protectionist stance on trade. The US Commerce Department launched more than 80 antidumping and countervailing duty investigations last year - a 46% increase from 2016.The investigations, which are typically triggered by complaints from private companies, can lead to steep tariffs.This week, the Commerce Department announced results in other investigations - including one against Canadian newsprint producers.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer called the complaint "a broad and ill-advised attack on the US trade remedies system".  He said: "Canada\'s claims are unfounded and could only lower US confidence that Canada is committed to mutually beneficial trade."  Canada filed the petition with the WTO on 20 December. It was shared with the organisation\'s members on Wednesday.The complaint allows for 60 days of "consultation". If it is not resolved in that time, it is subject to adjudication by a WTO panel.']	 CATEGORY:Business

CONTENT:  ['Passengers on Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern services have suffered the worst rail disruption in the UK, according to a highly critical report.The National Audit Office (NAO) said the UK\'s largest rail franchise had not provided value for money.It found the services had been the "worst on the network" since Govia Thameslink (GTR) took over the routes.The Department for Transport (DfT) said industrial action had caused a shortage of train crews.It is being blamed for not ensuring adequate staffing before awarding the franchise.Government spending watchdog the NAO said GTR had too few drivers when it was awarded the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise.It added that since GTR started operating the full franchise in July 2015, 7.7% of services - about 146,000 services - had either been cancelled or delayed by more than 30 minutes, compared with 2.8% on the rest of the network. Of these, more than one third were caused by train crew shortages. The RMT union is calling for GTR to be stripped of the franchise, after the "dynamite report blows wide open the whole scandal" of the firm\'s operation.Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: "Over the last three years long-suffering passengers on the Thameslink franchise have experienced the worst performance on the rail network. "Some of the problems could have been avoided if the Department [for Transport] had taken more care to consider passengers in its design of the franchise."A NAO spokesman said the DfT "did not seek sufficient assurance that Govia Thameslink would have enough train drivers when it took on the franchise"."Govia Thameslink received fewer drivers than it expected from the previous operator of the Thameslink and Great Northern routes, and driver shortages have persisted on Great Northern services," he added.The DfT admitted disruption to passengers was "unacceptable", but said services had improved over the last 12 months.A spokesman said: "The primary cause of delays and cancellations to passengers has been lack of available staff, which is a direct result of strike action."Speaking on the Today programme Labour\'s Lilian Greenwood MP, chair of the Transport Committee, accused the DfT of "passing the buck", adding: "Clearly the industrial action has created many of the problems that passengers have faced and it\'s important that the dispute is resolved. "But I\'m not hearing from the DfT that they are acknowledging their part in this and the things they need to do to improve the situation for passengers, who just a week ago saw their rail fares go up again, without seeing the improvements they were promised."Part of the reason they created this difficulty was by creating this mega franchise, by not looking at the implications of trying to introduce new services onto a very congested part of the railway where there was unreliable infrastructure."Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: "The prime problem on this network... was the action of trade unions. "There were mistakes made in my department, mistakes made in Network Rail, mistakes made in the operation of this railway line. I am extremely sorry."GTR said Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern was one of the UK\'s largest rail franchises, carrying almost one million passengers a day. Charles Horton, chief executive of GTR, said: "The report identifies numerous root causes for the challenges it has faced."These difficulties have sometimes been greater than expected and we regret the disruption caused to our passengers."']	 CATEGORY:Business 

CONTENT:  ['Nick isn\'t a vegan, but he is trying to cut down on dairy. So he has picked up a Fiery Tofu and Slaw sandwich from Tesco\'s brand new vegan range for his lunch today.Tesco\'s vegan meals-to-go - launched this week - aren\'t flying off the shelf exactly, but there appears to be some interest in this central London branch, and not just from the ethically-minded."I like meat too much to give it up," confesses Joanna. But she likes the look of the Moroccan-inspired bowl of bulgur wheat, spiced beetroot and humus - she\'s also keen on vegetables. So she\'s taking one of those.Tesco is betting that young professionals such as Nick and Joanna are the shape of things to come. And they could be right.A third of the UK population claims to be "flexitarian" - that is, cutting back on animal products.Moreover, veganism is currently flavour of the month, with backing from sports stars and celebrities from Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere to Jennifer Lopez.This month, thousands have signed up to "Veganuary": a commitment to clean up your health and your conscience simultaneously, by shunning all animal products from bacon to butter for a month.And retailers are banking on at least some of us sticking to this new dietary piety for the longer term too, though more often than not, they\'re sidestepping the word "vegan" in their branding.Tesco has commissioned chef Derek Sarno, formerly senior chef at Whole Foods Market, to create ready-to-go meals that sound more appetising than virtuous.There are crispy carrot "pastrami" and barbecued mushrooms, pumpkin falafel and sourdough pizza."For too long, vegans have been overlooked, with many offerings that are available seemingly created to appease rather than truly please," says Mr Sarno."Tesco has recognised the time is right to significantly expand its plant-based range and take it from a niche market right into the middle of the mainstream."More than , identifies as vegan, a tripling in as many years, with signs that the numbers are continuing to grow, especially among "generation Z" consumers - the mini-millennials, still in their teens. Vegan recipe books are on the shop shelves and veganism is a popular discussion topic online, as the internet makes it as easy to share links to films critical of animal farming, such as the popular "Cowspiracy", as it is to share an image of your multi-coloured, spiralised, plant-based lunch.Other supermarkets, Sainsbury\'s, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer, also offer plenty of vegan food from soups to sauces, curries to canapes, substitute sausages and non-dairy cheeses."It\'s companies following the pound," says Simon Winch, chief executive of Veganuary, the charity trying to encourage consumers to sign up - and maybe stick with - the vegan lifestyle. "They see the demand is there."Perhaps more surprisingly, budget supermarket Aldi also offers a long list of vegan-friendly products, from almond milk to potato waffles. "Retailers have had a tough time and so they\'re seeking growth anywhere they can find it," says Molly Johnson-Jones, senior analyst at GlobalData Retail."You can charge more for premium and free-from products, so they\'re really trying to tap into this."She says that if even the low-cost supermarkets, which stock a much smaller range of items than their bigger rivals, are choosing to give shelf space to vegan products, then it really is a sign its time has come."I don\'t think it\'s a fad," she says "I think it\'s a genuine shift."Veganuary\'s Simon Winch thinks vegans are also shaking off an outmoded image of lentils and sackcloth."I think historically, people have looked at veganism as cranks in sandals, an uninspiring diet. But what we\'re seeing now is a fantastic range of delicious options and that\'s why supermarkets are now proud to put vegan word on it."Although, in fact, most retailers tend not to, perhaps because of some lingering image problem, which might deter those just dabbling with the diet.Data from market analysts Euromonitor suggests over the last couple of years, the value of products sold with a "vegan" label has actually fallen (once inflation is stripped out).More often, products are labelled "free-from", healthy or plant-based.So while Tesco\'s new range is entirely suitable for vegans, they\'re marketed somewhat counter-intuitively under the label "wicked"."My aim from the start was to create recipes that were 80% healthy and 20% wicked," says chef Derek Sarno. "Recipes that would delight vegans and give them the options they craved, whilst also attracting meat-eaters and encouraging them to try plant-based foods."Mr Winch hopes that strategy will make veganism appear "sexy, cool, relevant". But on the whole, he\'d rather see clearly identified products that would make life easier for vegans out shopping.']	 CATEGORY:Business 

CONTENT:  ['Brexit campaigners have given EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier a hamper of British products during a meeting at the European Commission in Brussels. The delegation was made up of the Euro MP Steven Woolfe, Lord Jones, the chair of the Leave Means Leave campaign John Longworth and Labour donor John Mills.  The hamper included the complete works of Shakespeare, cheddar cheese, marmite, PG Tips and some English wine.Lord Jones said the aim was to show the UK had little to fear from no deal.The hamper also included:"It shows that we have great products that can still be sold in Europe but we are also going to expand," said former UKIP member Mr Woolfe. Lord Jones said he did not expect Mr Barnier to eat the items, although Mr Barnier\'s advisor Stefaan De Rynck, said it was well received:The gift has prompted Twitter to users to complain that it contained few products from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Some highlighted that the products were made with Spanish oranges or had been invented abroad. One pointed out that the Anglo-Dutch owner of Marmite, Unilever, had predicted that Brexit would have a negative effect on its business. Another hoped the negotiations would not be, ahem, hampered. Mr Barnier already has a groaning gift shelf. At the first round of talks he was presented with a vintage climbing book by Brexit Secretary David Davis. He gave his British guest an antique walking stick.  Jeremy Corbyn brought Mr Barnier a personalised Arsenal football shirt. The Labour leader received a retro railway poster from Mr Barnier\'s home region in France. It is all designed to build trust and generate bonhomie. Or in this case to also generate some publicity for a fairly run-of-the-mill meeting. But it rounds off a bumper week for diplomatic gifts, after the French President Emmanuel Macron gave the Chinese President an eight-year-old horse. The anti-Brexit Open Britain campaign was not impressed with the Brexiteers\' gift to Mr Barnier, however.The group\'s deputy director Francis Grove-White said: "We have reached peak Brexit. Self-important charlatans marching around Brussels with hampers of quintessentially British products, many of which are owned by companies that have said they are deeply worried about the impact of Brexit, does nothing to further the national interest."']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ["Theresa May had mulled over her reshuffle for months. On Monday she felt daring enough to do it, after ending the tumult of 2017 with the government in better shape than for quite some time, despite the embarrassing departures of some of her colleagues. The task was not to make radical changes, the most senior jobs were never in question, but the plan was to get the right reformers into the right jobs in her view, and to plan for the future. The question of the long term will still be dealt with tomorrow, when junior ministers are expected to be appointed, with far greater numbers of women and ethnic minority MPs, part of the Tories' effort to look more like the country they govern. New faces and potential new stars have already been despatched to Tory HQ to try to make a difference there. But in terms of the hopes Theresa May had of moving her cabinet colleagues around? Of three experienced ministers she wanted to move? One persuaded her he shouldn't have to budge, one was never even asked to shift, and the third, Justine Greening, quit in protest. In allowing Greening to walk, the PM has lost a Northern voice, who represents a London marginal constituency, who is in a same sex relationship. Even without her six years experience in the Cabinet, any one of those factors are precious commodities in the Tory Party. And while Justine Greening is a determined pragmatist - her detractors might say determination that can make her difficult - she was a strong Remain voice who could be tempted to join that powerful chorus of former ministers on the backbenches who relentlessly push the PM for answers on her Brexit plans. Even prime ministers at the peak of their powers can fall foul of reshuffles when their colleagues refuse to collaborate. One foiled move can upset the whole play. But while Monday wasn't quite Christmas panto, it was not the glorious return to the business of government planned to usher in 2018. Theresa May had enough authority to try to make her moves, but found she had not enough to deliver them all. "]	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['There were big differences in the responses of universities to the controversial letter asking for details of Brexit teaching sent to them in October by the government whip, Chris Heaton-Harris.While some denounced it as "sinister" and having the "whiff of McCarthyism", others were very happy to send the information Mr Heaton-Harris was seeking, and invited him to be a guest speaker or to get involved in their initiatives.When the letter was publicised it was denounced as political interference in academic freedom by numerous academics and politicians. Lord Patten, the chancellor of Oxford University, described it as "offensive and idiotic Leninism".But BBC research now reveals there was a much more mixed response in reality, with university reactions ranging from anger to enthusiasm. This is disclosed by a BBC freedom of information request, asking UK universities for a copy of their response to the letter.Mr Heaton-Harris, a staunch Eurosceptic and the third most senior government whip, wrote to most university vice-chancellors in early October asking for "the names of professors at your establishment who are involved in the teaching of European affairs, with particular reference to Brexit". He also requested "a copy of the syllabus and links to the online lectures which relate to this area".Of 59 universities that responded to Mr Heaton-Harris\'s letter, 28 were cooperative, providing Mr Heaton-Harris with most or all of what he asked for.Many universities sent online links to course modules and lists of the relevant academic staff who taught topics which could relate to Brexit. Professor Karen Cox at the University of Kent went further. After supplying the MP with online links to staff lists and course outlines, she asked for a favour in return - for Mr Heaton-Harris to be a guest speaker for a new Masters level module on European Affairs.The Dean for the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities at the University of Westminster, Andrew Linn, similarly sent links to staff research expertise and course content, and also extended an invitation for the MP to come to a debate hosted by the university on Brexit. A colleague of the Dean at the university asked in a separate email "If you have ideas/initiatives where you may want to involve us and students, please keep in touch... we also organise student trips to the Parliament and it would be good for them to meet and interact with you in the future."Other institutions who gave full responses about their work included the University of Sheffield, which provided a list of relevant staff and descriptions of the modules available that related to Brexit. The President of City University, Sir Paul Curran, similarly supplied the names and contact details of two senior academics who he said would "both be pleased to be contacted" by the MP\'s office for further information. In contrast 17 institutions entirely or mostly refused to provide the information asked for.The angriest responses came from the Vice-Chancellor of Worcester University, David Green - who first publicised the letter - and Bill Rammell from the University of Bedfordshire, a former Labour MP.David Green wrote: "I look forward to receiving your letter of apology for sending me this sinister letter in which you ask me to supply the \'names of professors\'.  I will do no such thing. If you are committed to freedom as you now claim, you will write to me by return apologising and withdrawing your damaging letter in its entirety."Bill Rammell said he shared the "deep concerns" expressed about the intentions of the request, adding: "I am not willing to share with you the names of academics teaching on the subject area of European affairs and/or Brexit, as your letter does not make it clear your purposes in asking, and I am concerned that there is a whiff of McCarthyism in the request and a desire to foment public opposition to perfectly legitimate and valuable academic activity."Several other universities gave links to basic course information but cited a mixture of academic freedom, commercial interest or staff safety as reasons to refuse most of the information sought by Mr Heaton-Harris.The universities of Royal Holloway, Northampton and Sheffield Hallam raised concerns that releasing names of staff could lead to "harassment", "threatening their safety" or "unwarranted repercussions".Another 26 institutions said they did not respond at all to the Tory MP\'s request. This could be a breach of freedom of information law, since universities are covered by FOI and the letter was clearly a request for information.Several universities told us that they decided to treat the letter as personal correspondence to the Vice-Chancellor and not as an FOI request. These included the universities of the West of Scotland, Brunel, Nottingham and Lincoln.The University of Surrey told us "We did not treat this request as an FOI, which in hindsight was perhaps wrong. We apologise for any misunderstanding, as we endeavour to respond to all requests under the Act in a full and timely way."Chris Heaton-Harris was approached for a response to the BBC\'s findings but declined to comment.  At the time of the initial fuss, universities minister Jo Johnson  that Mr Heaton-Harris was conducting research for a book.Fourteen universities replied to tell Mr Heaton-Harris they had no information to supply, as they did not teach relevant courses.Twenty-six universities told us that they did not actually receive the letter. They include Cambridge, Leeds, Birmingham, Plymouth, Exeter, UCL and Queen Mary.Fifteen of the 135 universities approached by the BBC have not responded to our FOI request.']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['Autumn sees Britain\'s political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here\'s a round-up of this year\'s.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn\'t bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45."I was about to talk about somebody I\'d like to give a P45 to, and that\'s Jeremy Corbyn," the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn\'t end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: "Building a country that works or everyon."The speech had been billed as the PM\'s attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to "let the British lion roar".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of "emerging plots" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour\'s week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was "on the threshold of power".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the "political mainstream" because its polices were "what most people in our country actually want".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government "hanging by a thread".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn\'s dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will "always make the case for independence" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The "essence of independence", she told activists, was being "in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at "close to cost price as possible".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be "truly transformational", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of "hope and realism".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of "masochism", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: "Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line."Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP\'s share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the "hurt" he and others felt at the party\'s loss of ground in June\'s election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the "little guy" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in "community bonds". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party\'s conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a "rail revolution". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June\'s general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting.']	 CATEGORY:Politics

CONTENT:  ['Damian Hinds has become the new Education Secretary, replacing Justine Greening. What are the questions waiting at the top of his in-tray? And what should he do differently to avoid the sudden exit of his predecessor?Damian Hinds will have to re-energise the Conservatives\' vision for education, finding something positive that will connect with the public.From the perspective of 10 Downing Street, it must have seemed as though Labour was making much of the weather over schools and universities. Parents were worried about being asked to bail out cash-starved schools. And Jeremy Corbyn\'s promise to scrap tuition fees had seen Labour\'s student vote reaching record levels. Justine Greening seemed unenthusiastic about the prime minister\'s Tory heartlands view of education, characterised by the push for more grammar schools. But, it is suggested, there was impatience in Downing Street about the lack of any clear alternative vision or policy offer for parents.There is a catch for Mr Hinds. His revival has to cost nothing and not take up legislative time consumed by Brexit.Theresa May has promised a major review of university funding and how much students should be expected to pay - as evidence that she was "listening" after the election.Jo Johnson, the outgoing Universities Minister, had made no secret of his reluctance for any significant changes. But his departure opens the way for a much more far-reaching review. The rising levels of fees, interest charges and student debt, have been like a recurrent political toothache, and Mr Hinds will be looking for an affordable way to neutralise the electoral pain.It\'s been the mouse-trap hidden in the in-tray for ministers of successive governments.And he will have to see whether university bosses can really be more restrained over pay, after the chastening battles over "fat cat" salaries.School funding gaps and teacher shortages are among the issues that heads see as most urgent. They are exasperated that they have to keep juggling and struggling on with what they claim are inadequate budgets.In the election it became a significant doorstep issue, not least because head teachers discovered the power of sending a letter home to millions of parents.When it comes to plausibility, head teachers\' warnings of cuts to children\'s lessons will always win out over politicians protesting that funding is at record levels.It\'s a challenge that the new education secretary will have to resolve. Otherwise he risks cold water being poured over any other initiatives, as heads tell ministers to get back to the basics of funding and staffing.Damian Hinds and Justine Greening have something in common. They both say social mobility is a priority, as has the prime minister. But what does it really mean? The government\'s own social mobility commissioners walked out claiming so far it had been all talk and no progress.Mr Hinds has previously highlighted the importance of investing in the early years, before the social divide begins to widen. He has also pointed to the central importance of high-quality teachers to making sure that the disadvantaged get the best chances in school.It might seem an age ago, but before the election the focus of social mobility was on the need to help "ordinary working families", working hard on low incomes and without access to good schools.Mr Hinds will have to decide how to make social mobility something more than rhetoric and good intentions.As a former grammar school boy from the north-west of England, with a Hampshire constituency, Mr Hinds will be seen as representing a less metropolitan view of education.He will be seen as closer to the views of Tory backbenchers, uncertain about the wholesale ditching of grammar schools.Mr Hinds will also be expected to push through a change to free school regulations, promised in the Conservative manifesto, which would make it easier for faith groups to set up new schools.This would allow religious free schools to give priority in admissions in the same way as existing local authority and academy faith schools.Such a change, likely to increase the number of faith schools, will be opposed by humanists and secular campaigners.But that could be the kind of opposition and clear blue water that would be relished by an education secretary wanting to assert his traditionalist credentials.Ministers have always been advised to pick their enemies as carefully as their friends - and Mr Hinds will also have noted that Ms Greening\'s bridge-building with the teachers\' unions did her no political favours.And someone somewhere is going to write a headline about the benefit of "Hinds-sight".']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['Northern Ireland\'s new secretary of state has reiterated her desire to restore devolution as soon as possible during her first trip to Belfast.Karen Bradley, who has never been to Northern Ireland before, said she had spoken to all the main party leaders.Ms Bradley admitted there were many challenges ahead.Sinn Féin said they would not be meeting Mrs Bradley but leader Michelle O\'Neill would talk to her on the phone for the third time.It is understood the first face-to-face meeting will take place next week.Mrs Bradley met the Democratic Unionist Party, Alliance, SDLP and Ulster Unionists on Wednesday.She will also hold talks with Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney in London on Friday."I have a very important job to do," she said. "My immediate challenge is to ensure that Northern Ireland has a devolved government in place to address the issues that affect everyone\'s lives - health, education and the economy.""I am also conscious of the need to deliver a Brexit that works for Northern Ireland and to ensure that everyone is safe and secure".After meeting Mrs Bradley, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the "clock was ticking" for a deal to restore devolution."I think she\'s (Mrs Bradley) heard directly today from people that they want to see government back here and if it\'s not going to be a devolved administration then it will have to be some sort of an administration direct from Westminster," said Mrs Foster."Of course we don\'t want that - we want devolution, but we can\'t continue without a government here in Northern Ireland. "So time is short and the clock is ticking."Earlier, Mrs Bradley said that it was fitting that her first visit to Northern Ireland was to the Titanic Quarter, as it represented NI\'s past and future."Once one of the world\'s leading industrial cities and now one of the world\'s largest waterfront regeneration schemes," she said. "I understand the importance of dealing with the past and securing a safe and prosperous future."Mrs Bradley also said her family was looking forward to getting to know this "amazing country".Mrs Bradley previously held the role of culture secretary, until Prime Minister Theresa May reshuffled her cabinet on Monday.She replaced James Brokenshire, who . Mr Brokenshire revealed that he requires surgery for a lesion on his lung, and intends to take a number of weeks off before returning to politics.Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since 9 January 2017, when Sinn Féin pulled the plug on its power-sharing coalition with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Mrs Bradley is the Conservative MP for the English constituency of Staffordshire Moorlands and has little experience of Northern Ireland politics.She was born in the Moorlands area 47 years ago and grew up "over the pub" in the nearby town of Buxton, where her family ran the Queen\'s Head Hotel.Her website states this childhood experience gave her "a unique introduction to people from all walks of life". She was educated at her local comprehensive school and later studied for her maths degree at Imperial College, London.Mrs Bradley then worked as an accountant and a tax adviser for almost 20 years, before entering politics.She was first elected as the MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in 2010 and successfully defended her seat in the 2015 and 2017 general elections.She has held a number of government positions, including senior Whip at the Treasury.In February 2014, she replaced her friend and colleague Mr Brokenshire as a junior minister at the Home Office.Her website states that during this role she secured the passing of the 2015 Modern Slavery Act, which it describes as a "landmark piece of legislation" that will protect people from enforced labour.In July 2016, Mrs Bradley was appointed secretary of state for Culture, Media and Sport.Her tenure was dominated by her decision to refer Rupert Murdoch\'s 21st Century Fox\'s takeover bid for Sky to the media and competition regulators.']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['While the EU (Withdrawal) Bill is briefly in hibernation, the accumulation of amendments before its Report Stage consideration will bear watching. Within hours of the end of committee consideration, a respectable number had appeared, mostly from the parties or the usual suspects - including Labour\'s Chris Leslie and the Conservative Dominic Grieve. Hard core parliamentary and Brexit nerds should keep an eye out for the supplementary programme motion setting out the timings and how the Report Stage debate will be divided up into subject headings - I\'m assuming there will be sections on devolution issues, ministerial powers and "anything else". But the absence of that Bill will not mean there is no Brexit legislation for MPs to chew on in the week ahead; The Taxation (Cross-Border) Trade Bill on Monday and the Trade Bill (Tuesday) are both important building blocks for post Brexit Britain - and they have the same generic issue as the Withdrawal Bill, which is that because they are designed to implement agreements that have not yet been reached, they contain very sweeping and general powers.So expect more talk about Henry VIII, and the importance of parliamentary scrutiny - as well as a fair measure of cooperation by "soft Brexit" backbenchers across parties. It\'s all process, so the biggest Brexit story event may well be whatever discussion there is of Michael Gove\'s proposals to reform farm subsidies, after Britain leaves the Common Agricultural Policy; it\'s hard to imagine that a public policy announcement of this magnitude not leading to a statement in the House, or at least an Urgent Question.Watch out, too, for the next moves by a series of select committees on issues of concern to them. The powerful alliance of committee chairs concerned about the funding of the NHS may swing into action, and if Labour are at all on the ball, they will be seeking an Education Committee confirmation hearing for Toby Young, after his controversial appointment to the board of the new university watchdog, the Office for Students. Watch out for the Environmental Audit Committee Chair Mary Creagh\'s follow-up to its proposals for a 25p "latte levy" on disposable coffee cups. Already she has written to the Speaker to suggest Parliament should set an example by cutting the 650,000 disposable cups it uses each year. All of next week\'s action takes place in the shadow of a government reshuffle, which might, or might not, be manifest by Friday. The result could be some interesting dispatch box moments with some new arrivals fielding questions with minimal briefing and some ministers who are facing the chop having to cope with jibes from the Opposition or - probably equally unwelcome - expressions of sympathy. That\'s all assuming the prime minister doesn\'t conclude that a reshuffle is more trouble than it\'s worth. Here\'s my rundown of the week ahead:The Commons launches into 2018 with Home Office Questions at 14.30 GMT, doubtless to be followed with any number of post-holiday Urgent Questions and Ministerial Statements.These could cover everything from the strain on the NHS in England to the situation in Iran, to those Michael Gove plans for post Brexit farm subsidies, to the possible selling off of the Navy\'s assault ship, HMS Ocean (which of Plymouth MPs Johnny Mercer (C) and Luke Pollard (Lab) will get there first, I wonder?).After these, MPs will move on the Second Reading of the Taxation (Cross-Border) Trade Bill, which will allow ministers to set up a post-Brexit customs system, to ensure that goods can move smoothly and safely in and out of the UK, and allow the UK to set and collect its own duty on goods coming into the country. The powers will have to be fairly broad, because the structures they will set up will depend on the outcome of the EU negotiations.Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats have amendments down to deny the Bill a Second Reading; Labour point to a lack of a coherent plan for customs and tariffs post-Brexit, the SNP cite the Irish border issue and the Lib Dems reject the Bill because it assumes the UK will leave the EU Customs Union. My Committee pick is the Communities and Local Government hearing on private rented housing, where the key issue is whether councils have sufficient powers to tackle rogue landlords. The committee is also using the session with academics and the homelessness charity, Shelter, for its pre-legislative scrutiny of the Government\'s draft Tenants Fees Bill, which would ban the imposition of letting fees on tenants.In the Lords, beginning at 14.30 GMT, questions to ministers include the former Chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee, Lord Spicer, asking about reporting to Parliament on Brexit; Lib Dem Baroness Floella Benjamin asks about commemorating the 70th anniversary of the arrival of the MV Empire Windrush carrying Caribbean people who had been encouraged to emigrate to the UK by the Government.The Green Party peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb will raise the establishment of an independent environmental enforcement agency before the UK leaves the EU, and the Lib Dem Lord Roberts of Llandudno will raise the arrangements for child refugees post-Brexit.The main debate is on the Government\'s Industrial Strategy and the case for boosting earning power and productivity across the UK with investment in the skills, businesses and infrastructure of the future.The Commons opens, at 11.30 GMT, with Foreign Office Questions - followed, in all probability by more Ministerial Statements and Urgent Questions.Then comes a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative Peter Aldous on Construction (Retention Deposit Schemes). He has a draft bill dealing with the issue of building contractors (including some local authorities) sitting on money owing to their sub-contractors, sometimes till they go bust. Various attempts to put voluntary arrangements in place have failed to bring an improvement.The main legislating is on the Second Reading of the Trade Bill - which, taken together with Monday\'s Customs Bill - will give ministers the power to set a new post-Brexit trade policy so that the UK has a new system in place on the first day after Brexit.The powers include allowing transition trade agreements that currently exist between the EU and other countries, and which Britain is party to through the EU; establishing the UK as a member of the Government Procurement Agreement, a key international arrangement which gives access to £1.3 trillion worth of government contracts and procurement opportunities in 47 countries; creating a new independent UK body, the Trade Remedies Authority, to defend UK businesses against unfair trade practices, and to ensure the Government has powers to gather and share trade information.Once again, Labour, and the SNP have amendments down to deny it a Second Reading. Labour\'s is rather interestingly-worded, noting that Britain will need a new legal framework for post-Brexit trade agreements "whether or not the UK concludes a new long-term customs union with the EU." This does not amount to staying in the existing CU, since the amendment goes on to talk about new trade deals that would not be possible if we did, but all the same it zeros in on a key issue. And there is also reference to the lack of proper parliamentary procedures to scrutinise what will be very important trade treaties. The SNP amendment explicitly says the bill should be blocked because it rules out remaining in the EU Single Market or the CU, with no assessment of the impact of that policy.In Westminster Hall the opening debate. from 9.30 to 11.00 GMT, is on the effect of universal credit on the private rented sector. It will be led by the Lib Dem Work and Pensions shadow, Stephen Lloyd, who has spoken in the Commons about his concerns that the 1.5 million private sector rented tenants on Housing Benefit across the UK could, unless the government make it easy for landlords to receive direct payments from tenants on Universal Credit, be in danger of losing their homes if they fall behind with their payments. He says private landlords can\'t afford not to receive rents for months on end, as councils and housing associations sometimes can, in emergency situations.That is followed by a debate on Luton airport expansion at 11 GMT. The Conservative Bim Afolami says there is great concern from Hertfordshire residents about the proposed huge expansion of the airport. He plans to use this debate to address issues like infrastructure - there isn\'t much in a rural area, he says, and noise pollution which he says is high even with the current 16 million passengers using the airport. With a government decision on Heathrow and other airport expansion expected at some point this year, this is the first in a number of debates on the issues around expanding various airports. In the afternoon, the Labour MP Ian C. Lucas leads a debate on changes to the Independent Living Fund. This will focus on concerns about the Welsh Government\'s proposal to transfer administration of the Independent Living Fund for disabled people to local authorities.At 16.00 GMT, local MP Tim Loughton has another in the series of debates he has led on different aspects of the Shoreham air show crash. This one will centre on access to justice for families of the victims - the specific issue is families of victims not qualifying for exceptional circumstances legal aid at the Coroner\'s Inquest, and the broader point of family access to justice on equal terms in disasters like Shoreham or Hillsborough.The Labour MP Dan Jarvis\'s Yorkshire devolution debate, at 16.30 GMT, picks up on the outcome of a referendum in South Yorkshire on proposals to create a Sheffield City Region authority, covering Barnsley Doncaster, and Rotherham - and perhaps ultimately extending into Chesterfield and North East Derbyshire. This has been the subject of considerable controversy, with many Yorkshire MPs and councils arguing for an all-Yorkshire super council instead. This would be a very large authority indeed - with a population greater than Scotland and twice that of Wales. Mr Jarvis says the referendum result (85% in favour of the All Yorkshire option in Doncaster and Barnsley) give him and his allies the mandate to tell ministers that the Sheffield plan does not have support and push them towards the all-Yorkshire alternative. Helpfully the Business Secretary Greg Clark - who was in charge of devolution in England in his previous incarnation as Communities Secretary - has argued that devolved authorities should not be imposed from the top down.My Committee picks are the Science and Technology hearing (at 9.30 GMT) on e-cigarettes - this is the traditional inquiry opener with experts and academics, and will focus on their relative harmfulness and the health effects on users. The meeting will also explore the role of e-cigarettes for people giving up smoking. I expect rather harder-edged politics in the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee hearing (10.00 GMT) on what would happen if the current Parliamentary Boundary Review is ditched. The review, due to be completed in October, aims to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 as well as equalising the size of constituencies. But a Labour private members bill - which might well command a Commons majority - could order a new review based on keeping 650 MPs. The Committee will hear from the Secretaries of all four Boundary Commissions (for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) as well as from elections experts Professor Jane Green, Professor Ron Johnston, and Professor Roger Scully. In the Lords, (at 14.30 GMT), the main debates are on the second readings of two relatively uncontroversial government bills; Firstly, the Secure Tenancies (Victims of Domestic Abuse) Bill -- this delivers the Conservative manifesto commitment to ensure that those who have a lifetime tenancy and flee domestic violence are able to secure a new lifetime tenancy automatically. Second is the Laser Misuse (Vehicles) Bill - which will allow people who target transport operators with laser devices to be jailed for up to five years and removes the £2,500 cap on the fine offenders can face. The Bill provides specific protection for drivers of trains and buses, captains of boats and pilots of hovercraft, and will make it easier to prosecute offenders by removing the need to prove an intention to endanger a vehicle.The Commons opens, at 11.30 GMT, with half an hour of questions to the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.On previous occasions the now resigned First Secretary of State, Damian Green, led for the government; it is not clear whether he will be replaced, or whether the prime minister will scrap the post of First Secretary altogether. The Chancellor of the Duchy is the Conservative Party Chairman Patrick McLoughlin, also widely tipped for the sack - so there may be more than the usual level of interest in an occasion that is generally treated as an appetiser for PMQs - which will follow at noon.The day\'s Ten Minute Rule Bill is proposed by Labour\'s John Spellar, who goes in to bat for the live music scene with a bill to provide planning protection for its venues; where new housing is built nearby, he wants to establish that if there are concerns about noise from the venue, the new arrival should be required to stump up for any insulation or other mitigation measures. He says there has been some sympathy from ministers, but that a clear change in the law is needed, rather than a change in guidelines.The day\'s main debate will be on a Labour motion, on a subject to be announced. In Westminster Hall the day opens, at 9.30 GMT, with a debate on mental health in prisons.Harriet Harman, the chair of Parliament\'s Joint Committee on Human Rights, will highlight their recent inquiry, which found that a human rights-based approach can lead to better prevention of deaths in prison of people with mental health conditions. Other subjects for debates include the Disability Confident scheme (14.30 GMT) and patient travel times for cancer treatment (16.00 GMT) - a subject raised by the former Lib Dem Leader, Tim Farron, in the last PMQs of 2017. He was concerned that when patients had to travel a long distance for treatment, it had a massive impact on the outcome. Finally (at 16.30 GMT) there\'s another airport-related debate on growth and noise mitigation at Gatwick Airport, led by the Conservative Tom Tugendhat. My committee pick is the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee hearing on the government\'s energy price cap bill, which is aimed at protecting vulnerable customers by lowering fuel costs. The witnesses are Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan and a government minister.In the Lords, at 15.00 GMT, the main event is the final Report Stage debate on the Data Protection Bill -  where the key issues will be data controllers, the Information Commissioner, a data ethics advisory board., class action on breaches, and a Leveson 2 inquiry. There is talk of a possible government concession on Baroness Hollins\' amendment on Leveson 2 - the second phase of the Inquiry set up by David Cameron, into press ethics. If the concession doesn\'t appear, the issue may be forced to a vote and that might mean a government defeat.The dinner break business is a regret motion from the Labour Peer, George Foulkes, on the transport policing aspects of the Scotland Act (Consequential Functions) Order.MPs open, at 9.30 GMT, with International Trade Questions, followed at 10.00 GMT by Women and Equalities Questions, and then the Commons Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom.The main debate is on a backbench motion on defence from the Labour former Shadow Defence Secretary, Vernon Coaker. It calls for UK defence spending and service manpower to be maintained at at least current levels, without the loss of any significant military capabilities. It has been quite a while since the last full-scale Commons debate on defence and the occasion should provide a rallying point for MPs concerned about the erosion of the armed forces - and in particular for increasingly vocal backbenchers like Jonny Mercer, who are openly threatening rebellion.This replaces the planned debate on the Restoration and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster - the multi billion pound scheme to restore Parliament\'s iconic Victorian home; this has been postponed because many MPs did not want it held on a Thursday, and a new, prime-time debating slot is being sought.... the latest delay in actually holding a debate that has been promised since September 2016.In Westminster Hall (1.30 pm) there\'s a debate on a report from the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee,.In the Lords, at 11.00 GMT, questions cover the UK\'s withdrawal from the London Fisheries Convention, additional funding to the NHS to prepare for winter, the import of poorer quality food produced to lower animal welfare standards from the US.Then there\'s a topical short debate led by the Lib Dem, Tony Greaves, asking what the government is doing about the Chinese ban on imports of plastic and other waste - vast quantities of UK waste had been shipped to China, so the move has huge implications for waste recycling in Britain.Then it\'s on to debates on subjects chosen by Crossbench peers; they should enjoy these while they have the chance - with the Brexit legislative load about to increase, future Thursdays are likely to be devoted to legislation, although it will tend to be the less controversial bills, where Committee Stage has been taken in Grand Committee. First the social housing expert Lord Best leads a debate on the performance of the UK\'s major housebuilders, then the film director and children\'s rights campaigner Baroness Kidron has a debate on the role played by social media and online platforms as news and content publishers.Neither House sits on Friday.']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['The 5p charge for plastic bags in large shops in England could be extended to cover nearly all retailers, as part of government plans for the environment.Environment Secretary Michael Gove told a meeting of the cabinet that he wanted to tackle our "throwaway culture".Shops with fewer than 250 employees are currently exempt from the charge, which since being  in October 2015 has cut plastic use.The government is set to unveil its 25-year environment plan on Thursday.Briefing the cabinet on Tuesday, Mr Gove said the government was "determined to tackle the throwaway culture which plastics encapsulate".The 5p charge on single-use plastic bags in England has contributed to a reduction of nearly 90% in their use, the government said.,  and  introduced their charges in 2011, 2014 and 2013 respectively and have also seen significant drops in usage.The charge applies to every new plastic bag used at large stores in England - but only shops or chains with 250 or more full-time employees.BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there would be a consultation on extending the 5p charge in England.Chris Noice from the Association of Convenience Stores welcomed the government\'s plans as being "good for the environment and good for the retailers taking part".He told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme that "approval for carrier bag charging is now very high" among the association\'s 33,500 members, and more than a third of the shops it represents have already adopted the idea voluntarily. He said: "There was a bit of an adjustment period when the initial legislation came in in England. But everyone is pretty comfortable with it now."Plastic bags at airport shops or on board trains, planes or ships are currently not included, and neither are paper bags.More broadly, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government would take a stand against the "profligate" use of natural resources with its 25-year plan.Last week, she said 50 million trees would be planted in a "Northern Forest" stretching along the M62 corridor between Liverpool and Hull over the coming 25 years, to boost natural habitats and give people access to more woodland.']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['An MP has called for a ban on high-caffeine energy drinks for under-16s, following the suicide of a 25-year-old constituent.Maria Caulfield raised the issue in Prime Minister\'s Questions. She said Justin Bartholomew\'s family were "convinced" his intake of more than 15 cans a day had increased his anxiety and contributed to his death. Theresa May said the government had taken action over high-sugar drinks and would continue to look at the evidence. Supermarket chain Waitrose recently announced it was banning the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to children aged under 16, following concerns over the impact of sugar and caffeine on children. Ms Caulfield asked whether, given the actions of Waitrose and campaigners, including Jamie Oliver, the prime minister would consider a national ban.Mrs May said the MP for Lewes had raised a "tragic case" and recognised energy drinks high in sugar could be damaging to young people\'s health. She said the government had introduced the soft drinks industry levy - a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, which takes effect in April 2018.But the Department of Health and Social Care would continue to look at the issue and the scientific evidence, the prime minister said. The British Soft Drinks Association has said energy drinks have been "deemed safe" by regulators but are not marketed or promoted to under-16s. Existing industry labelling guidelines require any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to carry a high-caffeine content warning and state it is not recommended for children. Last month, campaign group Action on Sugar found that typical serving sizes of energy drinks, at 500ml (nearly a pint), were larger than for other sugary drinks and were "completely inappropriate for children to consume".']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['UK manufacturing output is expanding at its fastest rate since early 2008 after recording a seventh consecutive month of growth in November.Renewable energy projects, boats, aeroplanes and cars for export helped make output 3.9% higher in the three months to November than in 2016.by 0.4% in November.Construction output in the three months to November fell by 2%, compared with the previous three months.That was the industry\'s biggest quarterly fall since August 2012, with the only bright spot for the sector being a 1.2% increase in new housing.For the month of November, total production was estimated to have increased by 0.4% compared with the previous month, with the biggest contribution coming from energy supply.This increased by 3.2%, mainly because the temperature was warmer than average in October, but colder than average in November.Economic growth had slowed in the first nine months of 2017 with higher inflation caused by the fall in sterling after the Brexit referendum, although the UK economy did grow by 0.4% in the three months to September.While the manufacturing figures are good, it is important to note that the sector only makes up roughly 10% of the economy.British manufacturing is riding high on two big trends - a weaker currency and global growth.Sterling\'s fall in value following the Brexit referendum has made UK exports more competitive.And for the first time since the financial crisis,  the three main engines of global growth - the USA, China and Europe - are performing strongly at the same time.That has led to car exports, for example, rising rapidly - contributing to a narrowing of the trade deficit with the rest of the world.That\'s the difference in value between what we import and what we export.Domestically, the economic picture is more subdued, with growth still sluggish.The weak construction figures are testament to that.But, helped by that positive world outlook, Britain\'s manufacturing sector has not seen such quarterly buoyancy since April 2008.And it is enjoying its strongest run of growth since 1997.Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers\' organisation EEF, said: "UK manufacturers were, in the main, in good shape as 2017 came to a close, with the majority of sub-sectors enjoying growth.  "Manufacturers\' expectations for the year ahead point to output and export growth being maintained through this year on the back of continuing support from a burgeoning global economy."This, together with an ongoing commitment from government to deliver on its industrial strategy, will be crucial in helping to propel the sector forward," she said.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: "The downturn in construction activity has been driven by new work in the private commercial sector, which was 5.4% lower in the three months to November than in the previous three months. "Looking ahead, Brexit uncertainty is likely to continue to hit commercial projects, while the planned 4.5% decline in public sector investment in 2018/19 will additionally dampen the sector."']	 CATEGORY:Politics

CONTENT:  ['It is a year since devolved government in Northern Ireland collapsed. But how has the lack of a Northern Ireland Executive and assembly affected life there, and what do people want from the future? It seemed a little late to be talking about Christmas, but Aiden Flynn remained focused on the celebrations just passed. The managing director of a large construction company based just outside Belfast, he said he kept thinking about the 40 members of staff he had had to lay off last year."That\'s 40 families who didn\'t have a great Christmas," he said. "And it\'s going to get worse, unless the assembly gets back to doing its work."The assembly he referred to was set up in Northern Ireland after the Good Friday peace agreement. It took on a host of legislative responsibilities, from economic development, to education and health. But more than anything, the assembly was supposed to bring together republicans and unionists in a project of common purpose.One year ago, however, that sense of common purpose seemed to vanish, as the republican party, Sinn Fein, walked out on the assembly, bringing about its collapse. Since then, there\'s been no authority to commission the kind of public sector work upon which Mr Flynn\'s construction company and many others in Northern Ireland depend."I would normally get a constant stream of work: refurbishment of schools… of hospital wards. I was hopeful they\'d get the assembly up and running again 11 months ago - but 12 months?"The ostensible reason for Stormont\'s collapse was financial: the ruling Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was blamed for the failure of a renewable heating scheme. Demands for the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, to resign went unheeded, but that demand has now been dwarfed by a whole list of requirements issued by Sinn Fein to be met before it will return to shared power.At The Maverick, a gay and lesbian bar in Belfast, I found customers mulling over one of these: that the DUP agrees to allow same-sex marriage, still illegal in Northern Ireland."It\'s great that one of the main parties is supporting equal marriage," one drinker told me. He said it might make him more likely to vote for Sinn Fein.But another was more cynical: "I can\'t help thinking that Sinn Fein has picked it up because it\'s something the DUP oppose. They\'re just using it as a means of contradicting them."Such political opportunism would hardly be unique, indeed it has become almost expected in an era of widespread cynicism. However, the writer Malachi O\'Doherty believes there is particular reason to doubt the face-value demands of Northern Ireland\'s parties. Put quite simply, he sees more long-term political and sectarian divisions lurking underneath. "Sinn Fein and the DUP have locked horns like old rams familiar with the struggle with each other," he says."We\'ve been through a period where we had some optimism divisions would be dispelled."Now, the more contempt you express for the other side, the more votes you will get."Not so, insists Simon Hamilton, a DUP member of the legislative assembly.He says: "We want to see the institutions up and running again immediately, but Sinn Fein have developed a fairly lengthy shopping list of demands."He mentions the call for an Irish language act, which would give Irish heightened official status in Northern Ireland. Mr Hamilton worries this will lead to fluency in Irish becoming a requirement for some official jobs. Moreover, he says, if Sinn Fein wants a language act, equal marriage, or any other measure, it should agree to re-establish the assembly, and then use it as a forum to press its demands.But Mairtin O Muilleoir is not in a mood to go back without guarantees. A Sinn Fein member of the legislative assembly, he dismisses its previous incarnation as being "founded on arrogance and disrespect". The late Martin McGuiness, then Deputy First Minister, was right to bring the assembly down, Mr O Muilleoir says. And he insists that same-sex marriage and enhanced Irish language status are fundamental to Sinn Fein\'s politics, adding: "Republicanism was founded on the basis of equality for all."It is exactly the kind of political-historic discussion that leaves Dr John Woods looking weary. Dr Woods chairs the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, where four of the five health trusts are . Yet plans for local NHS provision are now gathering dust, with no assembly to implement them."We very definitely want the assembly up and running… to take the necessary decisions," Dr Woods says. "In the absence of that, we will simply carry on with a system that is failing."This week sees a new Northern Ireland secretary appointed. The previous one, James Brokenshire, had to set a budget for Northern Ireland, in the absence of an elected assembly. But his replacement, Karen Bradley, may yet impose full direct rule from Westminster, if power sharing cannot be restored. And the assembly\'s headquarters at Stormont will become an over-sized, underused monument to thwarted hopes of the recent past. ']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['A senior Labour MP has suggested doubling council tax bills on the highest-value homes in England to ease the budget pressures facing local authorities.Chris Williamson, an ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, said increases could be staggered from 20% for a Band D home up to 100% for the top Band, H.Speaking to , he said his idea was not Labour policy.But he said it had a lot of support among Labour activists.The proposal was attacked by the Conservatives\' newly-appointed housing minister, Dominic Raab. "The last Labour government doubled council tax and now they want to hike it again. This latest plan would see people\'s bills soar by 20% and add at least £320 a year to the average council tax bill," said Mr Raab."Only the Conservatives have the balanced approach our economy needs to keep more money in people\'s pockets."  Local government leaders in England have said they are at "financial breaking point" due to cuts in their funding, most of which comes from central government.Mr Williamson, who is the shadow fire and emergency services minister, said his proposal for council tax "could be the only way of arresting the cuts and generating some income to start to grow local services".The amount of council tax paid on a home depends on which band it falls into.The bands are graded A to H based on an assessment of their value carried out in 1991.Under Mr Williamson\'s proposal, council tax would be frozen in Bands A to C, with increases of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% applied to the higher bands.The Derby North MP told HuffPost that under rules set by the government, a referendum would be required for the increases."You can imagine the Daily Mail and Daily Express would go to town on a proposition like this," he said."It\'s not a panacea, it\'s a response to a terrible situation. I think it\'s an argument that could be won."This is not Labour party policy, it\'s an idea I came up with at a local level and it\'s got a little bit of traction in other parts of the country. It\'s a reaction to an emergency that local government has been placed in."The government says councils in England will need to hold a local referendum if they want to increase core bills by more than 3% when they budget for next year.Combined with the 3% "precept" for those councils funding social care, it means some bills could rise by up to 5.99% without voters having a say.The referendum scheme was introduced via the Localism Act 2011 and applies to England only. In Wales, the national assembly still has the power has the power to \'cap\' local authorities\' council tax rises.In Scotland, MSPs voted in 2016 to end a council tax freeze, with the first increases coming into effect in April last year.']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['Theresa May has been accused of "buying the loyalty" of Tory MPs by paying nine of them about £10,000 a year extra to be party vice-chairmen.Labour\'s Chris Bryant claims the cash, which comes from Conservative Party funds, amounts to "hush money".The jobs were handed out to the MPs, including some who had lost ministerial posts, in Mrs May\'s reshuffle., they are being paid varying amounts depending on their past experience.A Conservative spokesman said: "Our new team of vice chairs bring a diverse range of experience to the party.  "The party has decided to offer some remuneration for these positions, reflecting both the importance of these roles and the commitment expected of them."The new vice-chairmen were appointed by Mrs May as part of a shake-up of Conservative central office aimed at attracting more young people and ethnic minority voters to join the party.Brandon Lewis was installed as the new party chairman, with James Cleverly as his deputy.The vice-chairmen include junior ministers, such as Chris Skidmore and Marcus Jones, who were sacked in the prime minister\'s reshuffle and will, therefore, have lost their ministerial salary of £22,000 a year, which comes on top of their £74,962 MPs\' pay.The new vice-chairmen come in addition to the party\'s existing four vice-chairmen and others given what Chris Bryant described as "semi-government" jobs, such as the 15 MPs acting as trade envoys.  "It has never been done before as far as I am aware," said Mr Bryant, a former Labour minister, of the new vice-chairmen. "It is basically a means of keeping them on board and extending the prime minister\'s patronage.""It means they can be sacked," he added, if they voted against the government or showed disloyalty.The size of the so-called "payroll vote" - backbench MPs whose independence is supposedly compromised by being given paid or unpaid roles in government - has been a source of controversy under successive governments.The Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975 says the maximum number of paid ministerial posts should be 109, with the size of the cabinet limited to 21 ministers.Prime ministers can also appoint MPs to unpaid roles, such as Parliamentary Private Secretaries, or invite ministers to attend cabinet without being full members - there are six ministers in this category in Mrs May\'s new line-up.The BBC estimates that there 105 Tory MPs - out of a total of 316 - on the "payroll vote," following Mrs May\'s reshuffle, but that is before the new list of Parliamentary Private Secretaries has been released, which could take the total to 150 MPs, nearly half of the Parliamentary party.']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['Tim Farron has said he regrets stating he did not believe gay sex was a sin during last year\'s general election.The ex-Lib Dem leader told Christian Radio he had been "foolish and wrong" and had spoken partly to try and get the issue of his faith "off the table".The committed Christian said the focus on his beliefs stopped him getting his message across during the campaign. "It was a little bit like having your main advertising hoarding permanently damaged and vandalised," he said. Mr Farron also said he had been right to step down immediately after the election, in which the party did not make as much ground as it had hoped, saying he found himself in a situation where "either I let the party down or I compromised my faith". During the six-week long campaign, he was asked repeatedly about his religious beliefs and, specifically, about whether he believed gay sex was a sin.After initially appearing not to answer the question directly, he said he did not want people getting the "wrong impression" about his views, telling the BBC "I don\'t believe that gay sex is a sin".In an interview with Premier Christian Radio, Mr Farron - who is now the party\'s environment spokesman as well as MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale - said he now regretted not being honest with himself at the time and admitted his answers had been motivated, partly, by political expediency.Asked whether he felt under pressure to deal with the issue, he replied: "The bottom line is, of course, I did.""There are things - including that - that I said that I regret. There was a sense I felt I had to get this off my table: here\'s a general election, a great opportunity for the Liberal Democrats... and all they wanted to do was talk about my Christian beliefs and what it meant.""I would say foolishly and wrongly, [I] attempted to push it away by giving an answer that, frankly, was not right."Part of the difficulty he said he found himself wrestling with was the different understanding of what sin means to Christians and non-Christians. "In the end, if you are a Christian you have a very clear idea of what sin is. It is us falling short of the glory of God, and that is something all of us equally share."So to be asked that question is essentially to persecute one group of human beings because sin is something, Jesus excepted, we are all guilty of. But if you are not a Christian, what does sin mean? It is to be accused of something, to be condemnatory, and so we are talking different languages.While he said he could have tried to explain the biblical teaching on sex and sexuality, he said it would have been "naive in the extreme" to expect journalists to give him a hearing on the theological details.While he did not believe there was "a wicked agenda" to marginalise or ridicule Christians, he said there was a risk of society becoming "tolerant of everything apart from the things we don\'t like".He added: "There are some who just can\'t comprehend that somebody can have really strong convictions and be a Bible-believing Christian on the one hand and at the same time really passionately believing in people\'s rights to make their own choices, which essentially is what liberalism is."As well as questions from the media about his views on gay sex, Mr Farron was also asked in Parliament by Conservative MP Nigel Evans whether he believed being gay was a sin. "I do not," he replied.']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we\'ve been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU  have now agreed on the three "divorce" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year "transition" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words itain and to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that "Brexit means Brexit" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals  She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party\'s seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland\'s Democratic Unionist Party.  .David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and remains around 10% lower against the dollar and 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany\'s 1.9% among the world\'s G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy has continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here\'s a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called "divorce bill", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: . They are now discussing a "transition" period and future relations between the UK and the EU.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries . It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU. - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on . It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This "Great Repeal Bill", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Labour\'s position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably "softer" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK\'s departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK\'s relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU\'s biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  .The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a "transition" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a "cliff-edge" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three \'separation issues\' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the \'divorce bill\' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a \'transition period\' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain\'s position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. The agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU\'s Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details It\'s worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don\'t yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a "sustainable" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain\'s population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government\'s target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a "take it or leave it" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark\'s overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC\'s Carolyn QuinnScotland\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year\'s referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK \'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement\'.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don\'t yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called "triple lock" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party\'s election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an "upside" or "silver lining" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the "customs union" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Probably not, , because there\'s no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, So in theory they could block the UK\'s EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU\'s highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, , do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year\'s election, has campaigned for many years for Britain\'s exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party\'s MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don\'t need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain\'s membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn\'t like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron\'s Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain\'s status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there\'s interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they\'ve had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France\'s chagrin", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it\'s hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. .In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK\'s net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU\'s financial year, shows the UK\'s net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and  that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don\'t exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his "emergency brake" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."The answer to Alan Rippington\'s question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU."So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. , four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK\'s statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We\'ve heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government\'s earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what\'s known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can\'t even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker\'s allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don\'t know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you\'ll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That\'s what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you\'d expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others\' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn\'t seem fanciful to assume that you\'ll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that\'s why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ\'s jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren\'t EU members.It\'s this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won\'t change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven\'t really talked much about tariffs. That\'s because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That\'s both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I\'m afraid he\'s going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it\'ll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK\'ll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don\'t think people will suddenly think the UK\'s an entirely different country.Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can\'t see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK\'s vote to leave the EU was "a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland\'s border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK\'s land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don\'t see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has .Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens\' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don\'t, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn\'t matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven\'t paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don\'t then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years\' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can\'t see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren\'t going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn\'t look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words "European Union" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don\'t really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people\'s old ones expire. So if you\'re looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens\' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you\'ll be able to do that but we don\'t know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens\' rights negotiations.Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.Send us your Brexit questions using the form below.

CONTENT:  ['Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have gone head-to-head in the first Prime Minister\'s Questions of 2018. What happened?Mr Corbyn started the new year the way he ended the last one, with an attack on the government\'s handling of the health service.Armed with statistics on the number of people waiting in ambulances outside Accident and Emergency units, he seized on Mrs May\'s comment to the BBC that "nothing\'s perfect" when asked about the pressures facing the NHS.Did she have any "words of comfort" for those affected, he asked?Mrs May repeated her apology to those who have had planned operations cancelled to cope with the surge in demand, but said the NHS had been better prepared than ever before for the winter pressures.She then went on the attack, asking the Labour leader to apologise for saying - in a previous PMQs - that mental health budgets had been cut.Children\'s mental health budgets have been "raided", Mr Corbyn replied, before moving on to this week\'s reshuffle and saying that Mrs May had wanted to sack Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt "but was too weak to do it".Mr Hunt stayed in his post and has a beefed-up job title, with social care added to the name of his department.Not for the first time, the two leaders continued trading blows on the NHS - Mr Corbyn hammering home his message on the cancelled operations, and Mrs May accusing Labour of "deprioritising" health spending in Wales, where it controls the health service.After Mr Corbyn said NHS cash was "feathering the nests of shareholders in private health companies", Mrs May - shouting to overcome barracking from the opposition benches - said private sector involvement had increased under Labour.The Labour leader was not the only MP to raise the NHS - Conservative MP Andrew Murrison suggested a royal commission should be established to look at the future of the service.It was Mrs May\'s first Commons appearance since she changed her ministerial line-up, and she was flanked by her new "right hand man" David Lidington, who was given a key role in the place of the sacked Damian Green.As well as the references to Mr Hunt\'s position, the sight of former education secretary Justine Greening on the backbenches was a sign that things hadn\'t gone entirely as planned (she refused a move and quit the government).There was also an early reference to the "housing secretary", the new job title given to Sajid Javid.The SNP\'s Ian Blackford focused on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill and how the UK government plans to repatriate powers from Brussels.Despite having promised a power "bonanza" for the devolved administration, the bill is "nothing more than a power grab from Scotland", Mr Blackford said.The UK and Scottish governments are locked in a dispute over what will happen to powers which are currently exercised from Brussels - whether those powers move to Westminster or to the devolved nations after Brexit.Mrs May said the government was seeking to improve the section of the bill in question, and that the ministers were "intensifying" their discussions with Holyrood.This week it was confirmed that the proposed changes to the bill .Another SNP MP, Pete Wishart, asked the PM to rank her Brexit efforts on a scale of one to 10 - she replied that the government was "getting on with the job" and he earned a telling-off from John Bercow for holding up a "nul points" sign.There was also a call from Conservative MP Maria Caulfield for a ban on selling high energy drinks to children  about the death of one of her constituents in Lewes.Mrs May said the government would continue to look at the "scientific evidence".Not the obvious phrase that comes to mind at PMQs, but that was what the new deputy chairman of the Conservatives, James Cleverly, asked the prime minister to give to her domestic agenda ("not me, don\'t worry", he told MPs)."I don\'t think he\'s ever had the kiss that he once asked for," Mrs May replied, to laughter.Wondering what was this all about? It\'s a long-running joke that dates back to Mr Cleverly\'s  on BBC Radio 5 live\'s Pienaar\'s Politics.The PM swiftly got PMQs back to the day job by promising the government would "do a lot more than Brexit".It\'s fair to say the watching press gallery was not overly impressed:After Prime Minister\'s Questions finished Speaker John Bercow revealed that there had been one person\'s question he had really wanted to hear...']	 CATEGORY:Politics

CONTENT:  ['Financial services are pivotal to the "bespoke" Brexit trade deal wanted by the UK, two senior ministers are to tell German business leaders.Chancellor Philip Hammond and Brexit Secretary David Davis will call for the "most ambitious" economic partnership in the world during a trip to Berlin.They will stress the importance of supporting financial supervision and not allowing banking "fragmentation".The EU has warned the UK cannot cherry-pick the kind of arrangement it wants. The second phase of Brexit negotiations, covering transitional arrangements after the UK leaves in March 2019 and future economic and security co-operation, are set to officially begin in March.However, internal discussions within the EU about the framework of future relations have already begun following December\'s first-phase agreement on so-called divorce issues like money and citizen\'s rights.Mr Davis and Mr Hammond - who are on opposite sides of the Brexit argument in government but nevertheless regarded as close allies - will aim to lay down a marker for the talks ahead when they travel to the German capital on Wednesday to address the Die Welt Economic Summit.In an article for the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper ahead of the visit, they acknowledge that their stated objective of leaving the EU\'s internal market and customs union means the UK will not be able to enjoy all the benefits it currently does as a member of the EU after leaving.But they insist the EU\'s desire to protect the integrity of the single market for its other 27 members is "not inconsistent" with the UK\'s desire for the most comprehensive agreement possible."It makes no sense to either Germany or Britain to put in place unnecessary barriers to trade in goods and services that would only damage businesses and economic growth on both sides of the Channel," they write."So as Brexit talks now turn to trade, the UK will look to negotiate a new economic partnership with the EU - the most ambitious in the world - that recognises the extraordinary levels of interconnectedness and cooperation that already exist between us."When we leave the EU, we will leave the Customs Union and Single Market, but in agreeing a new model of cooperation, we should not restrict ourselves to models and deals that already exist.""Instead we should use the imagination and ingenuity that our two countries and the EU have shown in the past, to craft a bespoke solution that builds on our deeply integrated, unique starting point to maximise economic cooperation, while minimising additional friction."David Davis and Philip Hammond want to "highlight the important relationship" between Germany and Britain.Today, they\'re preaching to the converted. Germany\'s business community - in particular the mighty car industry - are extremely jittery about the implications of Brexit. A "no deal" scenario is the stuff of nightmares for the German industrialist. Nevertheless, the business lobby stands - officially at least - firmly behind Angela Merkel.Her position, Germany\'s position, hasn\'t changed and it\'s unlikely to now. Single market access is conditional upon freedom of movement. There\'ll be no cherry picking for Britain.Don\'t expect to hear much from Mrs Merkel on the subject - she\'s preoccupied by the tricky business of trying to form a stable government.But whatever shape that government takes, don\'t expect any shift in tone from Berlin.Germany considers its relationship with Britain is important. But here the integrity of the EU matters more.The UK\'s preferred model for a post-Brexit deal is what Mr Davis has described as Canada plus, plus, plus - a reference to Canada\'s low-tariff free trade deal with the EU but with services included as well as goods.While not mentioning Canada by name, the two men make clear in the article that unrestricted trade in services - which makes up about 80% of the UK economy - will be pivotal to any successful deal.Citing the spectre of financial contagion which hung over Europe after the 2008 banking crisis, they argue that continued financial and regulatory co-operation within Europe after Brexit is essential if the continent is to "lead the world" in terms of enhancing global financial supervision."That work should not end because the UK is leaving the EU," they add. "On the contrary, we must re-double our collective effort to ensure that we do not put that hard-earned financial stability at risk - by getting a deal that support collaboration within the European banking sector rather than forcing it to fragment."The EU\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has warned the UK it cannot hope to get a special deal for the City of London and that its options have narrowed as a result of it turning its back on the single market.UK-based banks and financial firms are worried they will lose the passporting rights that allow them to trade freely in the EU after Brexit - an outcome which is likely to see firms moving jobs to the continent.

CONTENT:  ['"I\'d worked for years to get a full-time job in Westminster and the bullying began after half an hour." The experience of one man working for an MP in Parliament is revealed in new research by BBC 5 live.  It found 24 members of staff claimed to have been bullied by the MP they work for at Westminster. The claims were made in a response to a questionnaire sent by BBC 5 live to all staff publicly listed as working for MPs in Parliament. Some 1,500 questionnaires, guaranteeing anonymity to respondents, were sent out in November. In total, 166 people responded and their replies, although not representative, give an insight into life for some inside the Houses of Parliament. One woman said friends had told her she looked like a "battered wife" after experiencing bullying while working for MPs. The woman,  in her twenties, told us the first MP she\'d worked for had shouted at her, constantly threatened to fire her, made persistent comments about her love life and simulated hitting her. The second MP she worked for made a pass at her.     In total, 39 people told us they have experienced bullying while working at Westminster:A member of staff in his twenties, who said he was shouted and sworn at, said bullying by the MP he worked for led him to see a therapist. He told us he didn\'t report the bullying because he was afraid he would lose his job and didn\'t know who to report it to.     One woman, also in her twenties, told us bullying by her MP had had "a serious impact on my self-esteem". She said she experienced sexual comments, threatening and intimidating behaviour and being shouted and sworn at. "Items of stationery [were] thrown around the office," according to one male employee. "I was later told that the MP asked my predecessor, \'what would you do if I threw something across the office?\' as part of their interview for the role," he added.Many of those who contributed to the BBC research said bullying had seriously affected their wellbeing:One female employee who said she had been bullied by her boss had sympathy for the MP."The atmosphere can be hard but I know my MP is a good person under a lot of pressure. The office lacks capacity."Many respondents made the point that the way they were treated depended on the individuals involved, and most MPs treated their staff well. One woman said: "As an office worker I feel safe and respected. I have dealt with worse in other jobs. By comparison this place is excellent."The research revealed a reluctance to report incidents of bullying. Only a third of people who said they had been bullied reported the behaviour. The most common reasons for not reporting it was belief that "it wouldn\'t make any difference" and "fear of losing my job". The 5 live research also asked staff employed by members of Parliament whether they had experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment while working at Westminster. Three women in their twenties, and one woman in her fifties told us they had been victims of sexual assault. One claimed she had been assaulted by a former member of Parliament, one by a visitor to an MP and another by an employee of the House of Commons. All four said they had experienced unwanted touching and three had also experienced unwanted groping.  None of the women chose to report the alleged assaults.One woman said she had not reported it because she felt she wouldn\'t be believed and because she was afraid she would lose her job or it would have a negative effect on her career. The other three said they didn\'t think it was serious enough.Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has told The Emma Barnett Show on Radio 5 live that MPs could be sacked if they are found guilty of bullying their staff, under new grievance procedures.Mrs Leadsom, who is leading a cross-party working group into bullying and harassment in parliament, says she hopes the new regime will have "serious teeth".And she denied reports that the only new sanction against MPs judged to be guilty of misconduct would be to make an apology."If it\'s a Member of Parliament, then it would be a referral to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and ultimately to the Commons Committee for Standards, which has the ability to suspend Members of Parliament."And there is of course then the Recall of MPs Act 2015, that itself does enable a constituency to decide to get rid of their Member of Parliament.  So that would be the ultimate sanction."In December 2017, Mrs Leadsom told MPs an existing helpline for staff would be expanded and new training and HR support had already been put in place.She says the new grievance procedure will be introduced by the end of January and she hoped it would "change the culture" in Parliament.Eighteen women and one man told 5 live they had suffered sexual harassment while working in Parliament. Most of those people reported experiencing sexual comments, jokes or gestures with some having their body stared and leered at.   When asked to describe the culture in Parliament comments ranged from "sexist, laddish, misogynistic", "bullying of staff by MPs is rife" and "toxic: alcohol and power do not mix well" to "terrible. Staff have no rights, they work often in solitude directly to their boss. One cannot overstate the power of MPs and how intimidating that is to young staff".Others were more positive about the culture describing it as "courteous", "respectful" and "fascinating". One employee said it was "friendly and amicable. It\'s not the den of sexual depravity the media want it to be" and another commented "all the MPs I\'ve met have been delightful. I have the nicest boss I\'ve ever had. This sexual harassment witch hunt is ridiculous. ""My experience has been entirely positive. It\'s about who you hang around with" said one male employee.In the past year there have been several well publicised allegations of sexual harassment, sexual assault and bullying in the Houses of Parliament. As a result, Prime Minister Theresa May has set up a cross-party committee, headed by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, to look at how the culture at Westminster can be improved. The staff who responded to the questionnaire were unsure whether a new grievance system would help or not."I think it will be very difficult to ensure that all staff feel able to report harassment without fear of repercussions. It will take a long time to change attitudes."A man in his twenties who had experienced bullying said: "What punishment can be given to an MP?"MPs directly employ their own staff, and those employees do not have a human resources department to go to for advice or to raise concerns about mistreatment. At the moment, employees can only complain to the MP they work for, their party or the Parliamentary authorities. Many who responded to our questionnaire were concerned that if they complained to the MP who employs them, they would risk being sacked, or given a bad reference if they left.The Unite union represents some MPs\' staff but the union is not officially recognised by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA).  The Conservative Party said it took all harassment allegations "incredibly seriously". "If a serious allegation is raised we would immediately advise the individual to contact the police," a spokesman said. ""We have introduced a new code of conduct that ensures any allegations are investigated in confidence."And Labour\'s Cat Smith said bullying of any nature was absolutely unacceptable in any workplace. "Parliamentary authorities have a duty of care towards the employees on site, as do the political parties and MPs themselves," she said. "Those duties must be carried out and any allegations of bullying investigated."More on this story on the Emma Barnett Show,  at 10:00 GMT']	 CATEGORY:Politics 

CONTENT:  ['A new car designed by former BMW and Apple employees has been unveiled.The Byton - which sports a huge touchscreen dashboard - reimagines what it feels like to be inside a car.While on paper the electric vehicle doesn\'t quite match Tesla on performance or price, the firm behind it told the BBC it hoped people in future would care more about "digital power" than horsepower.But experts say it currently lacks the charging infrastructure it requires.The name Byton refers to the phrase Bytes on Wheels."We want to be the company bringing into the market the first real smart car," said Carsten Breitfeld, its chief executive. Ahead of the concept vehicle\'s official launch at the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas, Byton gave the BBC an exclusive look at the technology. It was being kept in an unmarked warehouse just off the city\'s famous strip, hidden from spying eyes behind a black curtain.The company is bankrolled with money from China, and believes it has the development know-how to overcome the hurdles that see most new car companies fail.To solve perhaps its biggest problem, Byton will need to strike a deal with Tesla\'s Elon Musk."What we want to try to do is merge your life outside of the car with your experience inside the car," explained Jeff Chung, head of Byton\'s Intelligent Car Experience division.In front of us is a huge display that stretches out across almost the entire dashboard. During the day it is bright white, but at night it inverts to be less distracting.The screen is part of what Mr Chung, formerly of Apple\'s Mac team, calls the "digital lounge". It can be controlled using touch, voice and Minority Report-esque gestures.A tablet computer is situated in the middle of the steering wheel, while an extra screen can be found on the back of each front seat.The main display can show any number of things - video clips, calendars, mapping, health data and so on. As you sit in the car, internal cameras will determine who you are and load your profile, adjusting the driving seat position and other customisations.When in full self-driving mode, or stationary, the front seats can turn towards each other for an apparently more comfortable and sociable position - opening up the middle of the car so that those in the back can see the large display.It\'s the most sophisticated interface I\'ve seen in a car. But I put it to Mr Chung that taking your hand off the wheel to wiggle your fingers about in mid-air might be extremely distracting while driving."I actually agree," he said."[But] all features of the car will be accessible via touch. And so you\'ll have the ability on the driver\'s tablet to make all the selections that you do with gestures."After you buy the car, we might actually pare down the gestures as people aren\'t very accustomed to it."We would never want to force any driver to do gestures to control specific features. Having the ability to customise is the key."Fearful of the car being spotted and posted on social media, my test ride was limited to a small area of the warehouse. It means I can\'t speak first-hand to the car\'s performance - but according to Byton\'s own figures, it will do 0-60mph (0-97km/h) in about five seconds.That makes the $45,000 (£33,187) Byton slower than Tesla\'s $35,000 Model 3. Indeed, on most performance benchmarks, Byton\'s car is less impressive. But Mr Breitfeld thinks to dwell on that would be missing the point. Just like our smartphones, he suggested the majority of consumers would base their purchase on which option has the best software rather than speed specs.The car is kitted out with the sensors it needs to deliver "level 4" autonomy - the level at which a driver can safely - in theory - go to sleep at the wheel. That won\'t come for a few years, so at first the car will only offer "level 3", meaning it can drive itself, but drivers must stay alert and ready to retake control at all times.Last year, Faraday Future unveiled , with huge fanfare and a pledge to get started on building it as soon as possible.Since then, it has cancelled plans to build a huge factory in Nevada, and its chief backer - LeEco\'s Jia Yueting -  that have seen his assets seized in China.Faraday Future followed a pattern of brazen new car companies finding it incredibly difficult to make their concept cars a reality. Even Tesla has struggled to manufacture its Model 3 car quickly enough to meet demand, frustrating investors who feel it is a make-or-break product.Mr Breitfeld told the BBC he felt Byton was protected from such pitfalls."I spent 20 years at BMW, responsible for the i8 programme," he said."I built this company right from the first day in a way that we have the people on board who know how to industrialise a car, which is a huge job."We\'ve started the construction of our plant in Nanjing, China. We are well underway."Unlike Faraday Future, the company is not relying on one major investor with "too much control". Among its investors is Chinese internet giant, Tencent.But one obvious challenge that might stump Byton is a lack of fast-charging stations.While Tesla offers its customers some 8,496 superchargers around the world, Byton has zero. Mr Breitfeld said he expects Tesla would be happy - or be forced - to share its stations."We have to come together and share this infrastructure across the companies," he said."This is not a differentiating factor. This is something which makes the whole industry successful."Tesla did not respond to the BBC\'s request for comment - and Mr Breitfeld would not say whether discussions had taken place between the companies."It seems highly unlikely that Tesla will want to share the infrastructure they\'ve worked so hard to build with a rival - unless there\'s some kind of altruistic view that it\'s for the greater good," commented Ben Wood, an analyst at the consultancy CCS Insight."It underlines the challenges of electric vehicles. Building the cars is relatively simple these days, but you need everything that goes around it. Charging infrastructure, more than anything, is the challenge."That said, Tesla has appeared to be open to sharing its chargers in the past. In 2014, Mr Musk told British gadget site Pocket-lint that it would accommodate competitors, but they had to pay a reasonable share of the costs."The intent of the supercharger network is not to create a walled garden," Mr Musk said."Any other manufacturer that\'s interested in using them, we\'d be happy to accommodate. They\'d need to contribute to the capital costs proportional to their fleet\'s usage of the network."For Mr Breitfeld, it\'s an inevitability. Just as motorists don\'t have different petrol stations for different car brands - so electric charging stations must work in a similar manner, he said.Follow Dave Lee You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370']	 CATEGORY:Technology 

CONTENT:  ['Sweden\'s Yevo Labs has unveiled a set of wireless headphones that incorporate metal made from seized illegal guns.The charging case and a band on the headphones themselves are made of a material branded Humanium.It is created by the Humanium Metal Initiative, also based in Sweden, and used by a number of Scandinavian manufacturers.One analyst said the idea should help the headphones stand out in a crowded market.Yevo\'s chief executive Andreas Vural acknowledged the $499 (£370) US price tag was "steep" but said 50% would be returned to the organisation that creates and distributes the metal. "It\'s the most valuable material in the world because you can\'t set a price on a human life," he said.It took two years to figure out how to work the metal into the product, Mr Vural added. The first batch was made from Humanium created out of guns taken by the authorities in Latin America.The headphones function by using NFMI (near-field magnetic induction) technology rather than wires - in addition to Bluetooth. NFMI has long been used in pacemakers and hearing aids, as its low frequency magnetic field conducts through liquid - even inside the body."Obviously you want the headphones to be good - there is an element that you\'re paying for the brand," said Stuart Miles, founder of gadget review site Pocket-lint."What you find is there are so many headphone manufacturers out there, to stand out from the crowd you will see more and more trying to do different things."In the same way as Apple does with its Red products [money from sales goes to support people living with HIV around the world] - Yevo is trying to showcase that they believe in a cause."Other audio-related products on show at the CES tech expo also boast of using recycled materials.They include the UK\'s House of Marley, which uses a fabric made from recycled materials for its headphones, and Armor 3D, which is showing off a Bluetooth speaker whose case is made out of reclaimed plastic.']	 CATEGORY:Technology 

CONTENT:  ['Start-up Black Box VR has developed a full-body workout in the form of a 30-minute virtual reality experience.It uses a bespoke resistance training machine and an HTC Vive headset. The entire set-up is about the size of a family bathroom.It is one of several innovations at the CES tech show in Las Vegas to propose mixing VR and fitness training.But one expert said the firm would need to address safety concerns for the idea to be a success.The Idaho-based firm\'s solution involves participants entering a virtual arena, where they compete against an avatar and, eventually, one another.The firm\'s founders, Ryan DeLuca and Preston Lewis, were also behind the successful fitness empire bodybuilding.com.Black Box VR\'s business plan is to open boutique gyms across the US, in which each member will enter their own "black box" space for the gamified work-out, which will track their progress.An at-home version of the equipment could be developed in the future, the firm said."Most people stop going [to the gym] after a couple of weeks so adherence is something that\'s a critical factor of what we\'re trying to solve," general manager Jim Bradbury told the BBC.One VR-industry watcher said the idea had potential, but had concerns."Human beings in general find it hard to retain the habit of exercise and there\'s been many attempts to try and make it more appealing - so, VR makes sense from the perspective of trying to make the gym less boring," said J P Gownder from the consultancy Forrester."But the cost of the equipment is going to make it an expensive get-up."And will it be safe enough for people to use? "I\'m not aware of the Vive having been stress-tested for this kind of use, and [Black Box VR] is going to need to prove that it has taken account of impact on the body of using the headset during strenuous exercise."Job Stauffer, a games developer who now works with the VR Health Institute - who is helping Black Box VR with promotional activities at CES - says he has personally benefited from virtual reality.He told the BBC he had lost more than 82lb (37kg) playing such games in addition to improving his diet."Late in 2016, I was probably the unhealthiest I\'d ever been in my life, well over 300 pounds," he said."And I started playing games on HTC Vive and Oculus and I started to notice that wow, like I\'m sweating I\'m getting the best workout I\'ve ever had."Mr Stauffer said he started by playing the indie game Sound Boxing, which he described as "Guitar Hero for the arms".He said he then moved onto Space Pirate Trainer, which he compared with using an elliptical machine - or cross-trainer - in terms of calories burned.The VR Health Institute is now developing a Pan European Game Information (Pegi)-style rating system for games to grade them according to their activity level, he added."A lot of people in the games business work an incredible amount of hours and often don\'t get the time that they need to take care of themselves," he said."At the same time playing games is a sedentary experience but VR changes all of that - that room-scale experiences are engaging your body in full."Virtual reality and fitness is a small but growing market.At last year\'s CES a firm called Icaros showed off a cradle that simulated flight while giving users a work out as . At this year\'s event a Czech start-up, Sense Arena, is promoting the use of VR to train athletes to play ice hockey, basketball and football. It suggests the tech could ultimately lead to .Meanwhile at the VR Fit gym in Columbus, Ohio, members can already work out with a virtual reality personal trainer for $60 (£44) per session.In my two-minute demonstration, I chest-pressed my way to victory in front of a crowd in a huge virtual arena, punching out bowling balls of fire and, inexplicably, large green birds as I pulled the machine, with more resistance piling on at every repetition. I was rewarded with a virtual sweat band in a prize box and aching biceps for the rest of the afternoon.  There was no noticeable latency between my action and the action I saw in VR, and the graphics, while a bit strange, were immersive. It certainly beat watching rolling news programmes in the gym with the sound down.The demo appears to have been designed with male testers in mind - the reps were heavy, and the only available profile to compete against was a macho avatar called Razer wearing green armour.But the firm was at pains to point out to me that ultimately people could compete against each other, and that other computer-based avatars would also be developed.Of course the concept of getting fit while playing a game is as old as sport itself, and Black Box has been developed by people who are already very motivated by fitness.After my brief experience I couldn\'t say whether it would hold my attention in the long run. But on the other hand, neither has my gym membership.']	 CATEGORY:Technology 

CONTENT:  ['You know an investment is somewhat unconventional when the Know Your Meme website is the main source of background information.But even in the turbulent world of cryptocurrencies,  is seen as a pretty wild creature.It was launched in 2013, inspired by a short-lived online craze for pictures of a particular Japanese dog breed.Last weekend, however, it nearly doubled in value and is now worth more than $2bn (£1.5bn).Dogecoin had been gaining steadily all through December, but the latest spike has prompted howls of "crypto-hype" from sceptics.Granted, it\'s still well behind the biggest beast in the digital currency pack, Bitcoin, which has a total value of more than $270bn.But given that Dogecoin was initially intended as a parody of the Bitcoin boom, its founder, Jackson Palmer, is none too happy now that it has slipped its leash."The fact that most conversations happening in the media and between peers focus on the investment potential is worrying," he said earlier this month.Until its recent rise in value, Dogecoin was little known beyond a small coterie of geeks.But in sporting circles, the cryptocurrency\'s backers have gained a reputation for some unorthodox sponsorship choices.In 2014, US stock car racing became a surprise beneficiary, when members of the Dogecoin community decided to give a helping hand to Nascar driver Josh Wise, donating $55,000 worth of the digital currency.That same year, Dogecoin backers raised $25,000 to send the Jamaican bobsleigh team to the winter Olympics.Sporting underdogs have clearly done well out of Dogecoin, but what about investors? Will they be barking up the wrong tree if they buy into the currency?Well, one thing to bear in mind is that dogecoins are far more numerous than bitcoins.The rules underpinning Bitcoin say that only 21 million bitcoins can be created - and that figure is getting ever nearer. It is unclear what will happen to the value of bitcoins when that limit is reached.Dogecoins are "mined" in the same way as bitcoins - that is, they are created using computer processing power.However, unlike Bitcoin, there is no upper limit on the number of dogecoins that can be produced, with a staggering 100 billion already in existence.That helps to explain why each dogecoin is currently worth less than two US cents, while Bitcoin\'s peak value to date was nearly $20,000.Common sense tells us that scarce commodities are more likely to hold their value than plentiful ones.But in the world of cryptocurrencies, common sense is perhaps a poor guide to future behaviour.And in the world of economic experts, there is still widespread scepticism about any and every form of cryptocurrency.Prof Ethan Ilzetzki at the London School of Economics told the BBC: "A digital unit of currency has no intrinsic value unless it can be used in transactions, and I cannot name a single cryptocurrency that is more useful in transactions than a credit card that\'s denominated in dollars or pounds or yen."There\'s nothing inherently wrong with privately provided digital currencies, but they need to be well designed and well thought out."They\'re worth a lot because people say they\'re worth a lot. I have very little confidence that they have any long-term value."']	 CATEGORY:Technology 

CONTENT:  ['In Las Vegas this week you can learn a lot about the exciting potential of artificial intelligence. You can also be left wondering whether AI is a triumph of marketing, yet to deliver real improvements to the economy and the way we live.One of my first stops here was at a University of Las Vegas robotics lab. Scientists there were working on projects ranging from drones to virtual reality, but they were also collaborating with the team behind one of the stars of the robot world,Sophia is a humanoid robot with a face that strays dangerously close to that "Uncanny Valley" where machines look just a little too human for comfort. She achieved fame and some notoriety when Saudi Arabia named her its first robot citizen, a stunt which saw many question whether machines were now being given freedoms denied to Saudi women.Sophia is the work of Hanson Robotics, an American firm with a base in Hong Kong. We had come to see her take her first halting steps on legs which are the work of this university lab.Then it was time for a handshake and a chat, with Sophia responding remarkably articulately to my questions - though I should say she\'d had advance notice of what I\'d ask.In many ways, this a hugely impressive project combining expertise in robotics, speech recognition and machine learning developed by American and Chinese scientists.But when I ask what practical purpose she serves, Hanson Robotics founder David Hanson is somewhat vague, mentioning work with autistic children and a role as a work of art.He is, however, a man with a startling ambition to use Sophia as a platform to achieve the holy grail, Artificial General Intelligence where machines can outperform humans at any intellectual task.He admits she is, in many ways, about as intelligent as an amoeba at present, but is hopeful that as she interacts with humans she will learn and grow. "Our aspiration is to bring the machines to life," he tells me. It\'s a vision that will be met with scepticism by scientists who think the humanoid path is the wrong route for AI, and with fear from those nervous about killer robots.Elsewhere we find more immediate attempts to turn AI into saleable products. Voice-controlled devices are everywhere, with Amazon\'s Alexa now facing a more sustained challenge from the Google and its Assistant. The two giants seem convinced that our homes will soon echo to the sound of people yelling orders at everything from the light switches to the microwave.And out on the Las Vegas streets the battle to prove self-driving cars are imminent is in full swing. I hitched a ride in an autonomous taxi, a collaboration between Uber rival Lyft and the technology firm Aptiv which has bought up AI teams from both Carnegie Mellon and MIT.The autonomous driving mode was impressive, keeping a close eye on pedestrians, but as soon as we arrived at Caesars Palace the human driver had to take over - the casinos are still cautious about allowing this kind of technology on their land.In downtown Las Vegas, I then hopped into a more futuristic vehicle, a taxi with no driver, no steering wheel or pedals. It made its way around a block of streets set aside for autonomous vehicles, but it was not the smoothest ride, with the vehicle lurching to a halt at any hint of an obstacle. Still, Navya the French transport company behind this project, insists its Autonom taxi will be in service in cities in the United States and Australia very soon,But the most confident statement about artificial intelligence at the conference was made by Baidu. Its AI supremo Qi Lu took to a stage to explain to a Las Vegas audience what his company did - "China\'s Google" - and why his country was  going to close the gap with its American rivals. It was all about sheer scale - China had far more people, producing far more data and there was what he described as a "friendly policy environment".That presumably means controversial technologies such as facial recognition can be deployed more quickly, creating a virtuous circle where ever more data makes the AI systems improve ever faster.But as this data gold rush continues and the hype around AI gets ever louder, it is worth remembering the great paradox - in a time of great technological change productivity growth has ground to a halt. Ever waited ages at an airport to "drop" your bag after thinking you\'d done the work by checking in online? Or stood at a hotel  reception desk as endless pieces of data are entered into a computer and thought wistfully of the days when you signed a form and were handed a key? Then you have experienced that productivity paradox and may be sceptical that smart machines learning from vast amounts of data will make our lives more simple and productive.']	 CATEGORY:Technology 

CONTENT:  ['Bitcoin\'s eye-watering price surge over the past year is proving too tempting to resist despite fears that cryptocurrencies are a bubble floating towards an inevitable burst. One group for whom it holds particular appeal is African millennials, writes the BBC\'s Catherine Byaruhanga from Uganda.Thirty year-old Peace Akware in Kampala is a convert to the cryptocurrency craze. Like any self-respecting middle class millennial here her smartphone is always within reach and with it her digital wallet. "I check my Bitcoin every day and any chance I can get. Any minute, any hour, anytime, as often as I can," she tells me from the small bungalow she rents on the outskirts of Kampala. Finding a job here is almost like a lottery for graduates so Ugandans often have so-called side hustles. Peace has sold clothes and even got into money lending. Both failed. But buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin appeals to her because it requires less of her time and there are no upfront costs. She\'s bought more than a thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin. So far the gamble is paying off and overall she is seeing her digital value rise.  "You know there\'s potential for it growing even further. I would like to buy a car. I would like to buy land. I would like to build with it."It\'s not just those hoping to get rich quick who are getting in on the action. In parts of the continent - especially commercial hubs like Lagos, Nairobi and Johannesburg - a small but growing number of people are finding that cryptocurrencies offer a cheaper solution to an expensive problem - transferring funds across borders. The technology platform Bitpesa uses Bitcoin as a medium to transfer cash across borders.It is like a remittance company. With traditional remittance companies like Western Union, when you transfer money initially it goes from your local currency into dollars then on the other side they receive dollars which are then converted into the local currency. You lose a lot of money in that conversion. What Bitpesa does is substitute the dollars with Bitcoin. It is cheaper, especially when there is a shortage of dollars in the country or restrictions on accessing dollars. It is also quicker because you don\'t have to go through long complicated bank approvals. Elizabeth Rossiello is the CEO of Bitpesa. Even as someone who knows how the finance world works, she gets frustrated with traditional banking."I\'ve been in Nairobi for the past month and I had three big banking things to do. "All three of these operations with three different Kenyan banks were cancelled for different reasons, or had delays or needed additional information so it took almost two-and-a-half weeks per transaction to get them finalised and I\'m an expert."Bitpesa has been operating for four years now and has over 6,000 customers across the continent. It focuses on big-ticket transfers - for example, paying suppliers in China or employees in another country. In Nigeria, when the government placed controls on access to the US dollar during a financial crunch, Bitcoin made it much easier for businesses to transfer cash abroad, something that has increased interest in cryptocurrencies in the country. In places like Zimbabwe, where there has been political and economic instability, Bitcoin has become a place to store value, buy goods and services from abroad and crucially a vehicle for remittances from the diaspora.Many central banks are sceptical. The Nigerian, Kenyan and Ugandan central banks have issued warnings about getting involved in the new and unregulated market. The governor of the Central Bank of Kenya went as far as saying digital currencies are a type of Ponzi scheme because of the way their value often fluctuates. Martin Serugga, a sharply dressed currency trader in Kampala warns people to be cautious too. He says unfamiliarity about the new financial instruments could lead to criminals duping customers out of their money. Nevertheless, he has started weekly classes with over 50 people attending to learn about cryptocurrencies and how to trade them against traditional currencies like the US dollar or British pound. He says high youth unemployment in Uganda is driving interest in Bitcoin and other products."If you don\'t have factory jobs and you don\'t have corporate jobs to serve the thousands of young people coming out of the universities this is an alternative," he says.Mr Serugga\'s class is made up of equal numbers of men and women, who are mostly young. They come to an upmarket coffee shop for their dose of the financial markets. The bright projector on the screen flashes numbers, graphs and bright colours. Joachim Ndhokero, a recent economics graduate, is still unemployed. His father encouraged him to attend the classes to make some money but it has not been easy. He lost over $900 (£664) in a trade gone wrong. Before he lost all his money, he had just made a $200 profit. Then he went to the cinema and lost everything."I think it was within like two hours. "That day I learnt that for cryptocurrencies, since they have a bigger spread, they can easily bring in losses.  If it\'s a loss, it\'s really a loss."The expert advice here is "use what you can afford to lose". But it\'s not just the currency aspect of this technology that people think will transform the continent. Digital security expert Neil Blazevic sees the blockchain technology which underpins cryptocurrencies as the more important innovation. Blockchain is a form of recording data that cannot be tampered with or hacked. It can be used for documents from contracts drawn up by lawyers to land registries.  He lists many more applications."If African developers, entrepreneurs, and governments can leverage blockchain technologies, they may have a shot at tackling some of the continent\'s most intractable problems of the unbanked masses, digital identities, untrusted voting systems, to name only a few applications," Mr Blazevic explains."With the right support for innovation, and collaboration Africa could once again leapfrog over the digital divide and become a market leader just like it did in the move from landline communications infrastructure to the mobile phone ecosystem."One person who has fully embraced the African mobile phone revolution is Ms Akware. She continues to watch over her digital wallet. She knows that the value of Bitcoin could fall at any moment. If all fails she will probably start again from scratch with a new venture. For the moment she is holding on, hoping to buy her first car in two months. ']	 CATEGORY:Technology

CONTENT:  ['January is a peak time for downloading health and fitness apps and putting those Christmas present fitness trackers to work. But do they actually help you stay motivated?After the Christmas self-indulgence comes the inevitable New Year\'s resolution to get fit, lose weight, and eat more healthily. But while 65% of us make resolutions, only 12% successfully keep to them, polling firm ComRes finds. Can tech help?When Sarah, 34, a law professor from Australia, wanted to lose weight last year, she took the unusual approach of placing bets that she would achieve her exercise goals. Breast cancer had stopped her exercise routine, and she\'d gained weight during a year which included three operations, she says."I was returning to exercise by hiking and trying to lose some of the weight I\'d put on while being sedentary," she says.She began a new exercise routine eight weeks after finishing breast reconstruction surgery. With a wearable activity tracker, she monitored the steps she took each day and the calories she burned.But she also motivated herself with an app, Step Bet, that let her wager whether she would achieve her exercise goals."I did three one-month bets and three six-month bets, and lost 7kg [15 lbs] - 10% of my body weight," says Sarah.She also says she made £358 [$458; €403].  "I like losing fat. I don\'t like losing money. The effect? Motivation!" she explains.For the data-minded, tracking your progress with reams of measurements is enough to stay motivated.Arshia Gratiot, who is 40 and originally from Bangalore, has been using a fitness tracker for a year, "to measure biometrics such as my heart rate, associated with my level of fitness," she says.In 2016, she founded a technology start-up with offices in Finland, India, and London. Frequently travelling across time zones made her decide to go running each evening - sometimes in the middle of the night - while listening to podcasts.  "It was either lie in bed like a zombie, totally jet-lagged, or hit the road.  It was the only way I could stay sane," she says.Tracking her heart rate and metabolism offered "a visual way to track progress over time" and encouraged her, says Ms Gratiot.But it\'s how we use such data that matters, argues Anil Aswani, an assistant professor in industrial engineering and operations research at the University of California, Berkeley."Personalized goal setting is a very important aspect of these apps," he says The better exercise apps learn from how you\'ve done in the past to tailor your goals, he argues. And doing this builds a sense of achievement, which behavioural psychologists say is important in altering your habits."If you\'re effective at meeting goals today, it boosts your confidence and makes you more likely to meet your goals in the future," says Prof Aswani.In his own research, one group of test subjects was given a changing number of steps as a goal each day, based on their previous progress. Another was assigned the same number of steps every day.The group given adaptive goals averaged about 1,000m more each day, he says.Joseph Laws, a former US army Ranger who served in Afghanistan and afterwards worked as a software engineer at Google, has developed his own way of setting adaptive goals. Based on his army experience, he began developing fitness routines for friends and family. Later, he started developing machine learning algorithms to find out which exercises best built fitness, based on age, sex, height, and weight.Mr Laws released the official version of his app, Optimize, six months ago.The challenge was "developing a model of fitness, and mapping those equations to actual exercises," he says. Once he had the model in place, his algorithms could learn and improve each time a person exercised. The workouts would then adapt to the person\'s past performance.Around 90% of users who make it to their fourth workout continue to use it for the next two months, he says. Most of the data comes from people "20 to 50 years old", he says, so the next challenge is gathering more data from older exercisers, and other non-typical groups, such as people with injuries.Other fitness start-ups are trying to apply machine learning to calorie counting.Charles Teague\'s app, Lose It!, began by asking users to log everything they ate, then keeping track of their calories and nutrients, he says.This, as everyone knows who\'s tried it, is a bit of a faff."So wouldn\'t it be great if you could just take a picture of your food, and it was just logged?" he asks.A year ago, he introduced a feature called Snap It, which is learning how to identify food on a plate. "The data we\'ve accumulated today would do things like recognise that\'s pasta, that\'s an apple, that\'s a banana," says Mr Teague.But more data is needed if the app is to discern spaghetti bolognese from fettuccine alfredo, for example.At the moment, users train the algorithm as they use it, by selecting the precise type of food in front of them from options the algorithm identifies. So it will take time before the app becomes sufficiently clever to recognise most food variants.With the World Health Organisation saying obesity is now more common than under-nutrition, researchers agree apps based on health and psychological research have the potential to transform how we eat and exercise.But of 29,000 apps relating to weight loss and fitness, only 17 were based on verifiable scientific research, a 2016 study at the Catholic University of Louvain found.Despite this, the global mobile fitness app market grew from $1.8bn in 2016 to $2.2bn, says research firm Statista, while the fitness wearables market was worth $6.1bn in 2017, a figure expected to reach $7.5bn by 2022.So as well as thinking about what you eat and how far you run, it\'s worth checking out the credentials of the fitness app or tracker first before committing your hard-earned cash.What works for you will depend largely on your personality and what pushes your motivational buttons.']	 CATEGORY:Technology 

CONTENT:  ['All aboard the (self-driving) bus - next stop, CES: Las Vegas\' annual gigantic tech fest.About 4,000 companies - many of them start-ups - are arriving in town this weekend. Over the coming days, they will reveal new products, secure orders and hopefully provide a taste of the future at the trade fair.The event has its roots in consumer gadgets, but now sprawls into fields including artificial intelligence, automobiles, medicine, marketing and even agriculture.Most of the big technology brands in attendance will have something new to brag about. But increasingly, they hold flagship products back for stand-alone events. In recent years much of the excitement has instead been delivered by smaller, lesser-known companies for whom CES presents a "break-out" opportunity.Below is a sample of what to expect, including several exclusive hands-on videos with some of the new tech: If one firm could be said to have "won" last year\'s expo, it was Amazon. From fridges to cars, watches to robots, device-makers fell over themselves to support or build in its Alexa smart helper, leaving Google\'s Assistant trailing in its wake. New cooking , so watch out for a flurry of Alexa-connected microwaves this time round.Google is, however, still in the fight. Earlier this week, LG revealed its latest top-end TVs will feature the Assistant.And this year, the search giant has booked a CES booth to show off its AI, as well as splurging on a new paint job for the Las Vegas monorail to promote it.While the battle to secure the most tie-ups will likely be intense, one trend to look out for is products that provide the best of both worlds. GE has  that supports both companies\' virtual assistants, and HTC already sells a smartphone that answers to both AIs\' wake words."We believe customer choice is important, and that multiple AIs can be complementary of each other," an Amazon spokesman told the BBC.Elsewhere, expect "AI-enhanced" to be the buzz phrase of the moment, even if it\'s not always clear what that means."AI has become an overused term - often it just refers to there being a voice component or related cloud service," commented Simon Bryant from the consultancy Futuresource.He added that the key question to ask was whether the promise of artificial intelligence meant a device or service would become better over time.So, to take one example, when HiRide Suspensions promises  that uses AI, does it mean its electronics will learn to deliver a smoother ride over time, or merely that they have developed algorithms that would always deal with the same bump in the road in the same way?The Italian start-up\'s pre-CES materials are unclear on the matter. The so-called wellness market could prove to be CES\' most vibrant sector this year.One recent forecast suggested the world\'s annual healthcare spend will be nearly . Both the big brands and start-ups believe there\'s an opportunity to disrupt a sector currently dominated by specialists.Doubtless, not all the claims being made at CES will stand up to scrutiny, but it\'s heartening to see new tech trying to do something truly useful.For example, Israel\'s ICI Vision is in town to promote a pair of prototype glasses designed to tackle blind spots caused by retinal diseases.It is trying to combine small cameras, eye-tracking software and projection tech to direct views onto the healthy parts of the back of a patient\'s eye.Samsung is taking a  with Relumino - glasses that use a smartphone to process the wearer\'s view. An app adds contrast, draws outlines and makes other colour changes to the view to make it clearer before floating the altered image into the eyewear\'s display.Several firms are seeking to treat undesired behaviour via vibration-based "haptic" feedback. They include Keen - a smart bracelet that buzzes if it detects the wearer pulling their hair or picking their skin - and Snore Circle - an eye-mask that vibrates at different levels of intensity to nudge the owner into a different position if they make noises at night.New parents also appear to be a favoured target for the latest health tech.Stand-out launches include Me.Mum, a smartphone camera attachment  mould-like particles in a woman\'s saliva that signal when she is at her most fertile.China\'s Tuoxiao will be demoing a smart stethoscope designed for use with infants that sends heart and lung readings to the cloud for analysis to determine if pneumonia might be present.Meanwhile, two European start-ups are seeking to help women strengthen their pelvic floor muscles to combat bladder leaks caused by childbirth.Fizimed\'s solution involves exercising with a force-sensing silicone device that provides feedback via an app. Lifesense Group\'s offering centres on smart underwear that tracks the reduction of urine loss over time in order to motivate its owner to keep exercising.The surprise success of smart speakers has meant that the smart home and wider "internet-of-things" category is finally taking off.A flood of water use-tracking, temperature-adjusting, humidity-measuring, pollution-detecting gizmos will be on show, as well as dozens of smart locks - even though consumers remain suspicious about letting apps control access to their homes.There are, however, some participants seeking to break out from the crowd by taking a different approach.Crownstone is promoting a system in which a home\'s lights and plug sockets automatically react to a resident\'s presence based on them having a Bluetooth-broadcasting wearable or smartphone on them, rather than waiting to be given a command.Miliboo will be showing off a smart sofa that not only wirelessly charges your handset or tablet but also keeps track of how long you\'ve been sat in front of the TV while monitoring your posture.Smarter homes will also be pitched as being safer homes.Several companies will show off fall-detectors to warn if elderly residents have taken a tumble, and a safe that sends a smartphone alert if it detects it has been tampered with will also debut.But perhaps most the extreme system we\'ve spotted so far comes from Cherry Labs.The Silicon Valley-based firm uses cameras and audio sensors to keep track of which family members and pets are in which room at what time.It then collates a twice-daily log of their activities for the person in charge.On the flip side, if the idea of being put under surveillance makes you feel queasy, Cone of Silence promises to prevent your smart speakers being able to eavesdrop on you - accidentally or otherwise.It works by generating a white noise signal specifically designed to overload the speakers\' microphone arrays.LG has already shown off an outsized 8K TV - with 16 times as many pixels as a 1080p "full HD" screen - ahead of CES.But with a distinct lack of content for the super hi-vision format available, expect the focus to remain on 4K for the time being.Manufacturers may instead try to convince enthusiasts to upgrade by boosting the maximum brightness levels of their screens, which has the benefit of delivering superior high dynamic range (HDR) images. As a result, glints of sunlight off water can be more startling, and shadows can reveal more detail.Several brands will likely add support for Samsung\'s HDR10+ standard, which is designed to prevent details in the brightest parts of the image being blown out on on some screens - a problem the rival Dolby Vision format already tackles.And some of the higher-end sets may also introduce support for the new HDMI 2.1 specification, which can handle higher data rates and potentially allow screens to be sent 4K video at up to 120 frames per second. But the big question is whether Samsung will unveil a "micro-LED" TV.The technology uses tiny components that emit their own light rather than relying on a backlight. This allows micro-LEDs to deliver the kind of deep blacks currently restricted to the OLED displays that LG specialises in.But micro-LEDs should also be capable of brighter output than OLED, making it a superior choice for HDR content.Those with a good memory may recall that Sony showed off a Crystal LED TV in 2012 based on the same technology.That never went into mass production because it proved too expensive to make. We\'ll soon find out whether Samsung has found a way to keep costs down.The rise of electric-powered cars and self-driving technologies have seen automobiles take on a greater role at CES.This year, Ford\'s new chief executive, Jim Hackett, is delivering one of the event\'s high-profile keynote presentations, where company bosses often like to make a splash with headline-grabbing reveals.Hyundai has promised to debut a hydrogen fuel cell-powered sports utility vehicle (SUV).And Nissan says it will demonstrate a bonkers-sounding brain-to-vehicle interface. It involves using a brainwave-reading headset to anticipate when steering wheel turns or accelerator pedal presses are about to be made. The idea is that cars can use this information to "enhance" their response as well as source more data for autonomous driving research.In general, however, the big automakers tend to hold their most significant news back until the Detroit Auto Show, which begins the day after CES ends this year.That gives smaller rivals a chance to grab attention.This year, Chinese electric car start-up Byton will be premiering a model with a gigantic dashboard touchscreen, which it plans to put into production in 2019.From the US, Fisker will formally reveal a $129,000 (£95,125) luxury electric sports car with a 400 mile (643km) range and fast-charging capabilities.France\'s Navya will reveal details about a plan to deploy "robo-taxis across the world.Switzerland\'s concept vehicle designer Rinspeed will show off Snap - a modular design in which a passenger pod detaches from its skateboard-like underside.Faraday Future returns, despite its cash struggles, to host an invite-only update about its self-proclaimed Tesla-killer, the FF91.And Electra Meccanica may have the oddest electric car on show - a three-wheeler that looks like a Reliant Robin in reverse.It would be wrong, however, to think the only transport options on show will be cars.Yamaha intends to demo a self-driving motorcycle prototype racing at speeds above 120mph.And Surefly has been given permission to fly a sci-fi inspired passenger octacopter. The plan is for the drone to eventually autonomously carry two passengers to their destination.But a pilot will be involved for the CES test.There will be plenty of smaller drones too at CES.Market-leader DJI is attending, but has not unveiled major new product lines at the show in past years.It will, however, be aware that several rivals have pre-announced what look like copycats of its popular fold-up Mavic Pro model, and many of its customers are hoping it will fire back with a second-generation version.What\'s fascinating about several of the other new drones is how distinctive they are."The reason that we\'re seeing drone-makers specialising in different areas is that the technology has become extremely commoditised, so to succeed you need a specific use case of your own," commented tech consultant Ben Wood from CCS Insight.One example is Nuaviation\'s Hyperlift 200E, which is designed to carry objects weighing up to 200lb (91kg) at high speeds, and is being pitched as a delivery tool for the construction industry.Another is the Sirius CX-180, which features two powerful LED lamps, and is designed for use in night-time search-and-rescue missions.There\'s also a model with a video screen designed to be used by desk-bound security guards, and a drone that\'s been engineered to fly around warehouses scanning the shelves to check the inventory.But perhaps the award for most novel use of a quadcopter should go to SwellPro\'s Splash Drone 3.It is designed to help fishing expeditions catch tuna, sharks and other large sea life by dropping bait from above.Recent revelations about  threaten to cast a shadow over new computer launches at CES.Even so, Qualcomm will likely be trumpeting the battery-life benefits of powering Windows 10 PCs with its smartphone chips, which became possible after Microsoft added support for ARM\'s architecture.Meanwhile, Intel will be promoting the virtue of new processor modules that integrate AMD\'s graphics hardware, which it hopes will prove attractive to gamers.When it comes to handsets, there are rumours that Samsung might unveil a Galaxy X model with a foldable display.But if that fails to make an appearance, there will still be a new phone from China\'s Vivo that carries out fingerprint scans by getting its users to tap the display.This makes it possible to offer an "all-screen" device without forcing fingerprint readings to be done on the rear.And for those who prefer their tech to be more retro, London\'s Planet Computers will be showing off Gemini.The clamshell handheld resembles the long-retired Psion computer but gives it an Android twist, as you can see below.The Oculus Rift and HTC Vive virtual reality headsets have now been on sale for nearly two years, and sales haven\'t been stellar.Sony\'s PlayStation VR has fared a bit better, but what many are hoping will turbo-charge demand is the emergence of standalone headsets that don\'t need to be linked to a PC or powered by a phone.The move could make them much easier to deploy in schools and marketing campaigns, for example, and help them break out of a gaming niche.At CES, Austrian start-up Exchimp will gatecrash the market with its solution.Lenovo is also rumoured to be ready to show off its Mirage Solo model. And HTC could announce that it\'s ready an international launch for its all-in-one Vive Focus, which is already on sale in China.Much of the other VR hardware news out of the show is likely to be about prototype controls for the technology, with various attempts to put sensors and robotic gloves on people\'s hands or to recognise their gestures via cameras and sound wave sensors.Ultimately, many believe augmented reality - in which graphics are mixed together with real-world views - has more potential.But while there are several firms showing off AR apps and components designed for use in reality-mixing smart glasses, it seems unlikely a market-ready high-quality headset will emerge for at least another year or two.However, for those just wanting a taste of the tech there are a few solutions on show, including the cardboard-based fold-up Aryzon into which you slot a phone.There should be more robots than ever before at this year\'s event. LG and Honda are among the bigger firms showing off new models, which include a luggage-carrying hotel droid and a face-pulling "compassionate" companion.How practical any of them are is another matter.Nonetheless, we\'re promised innovations including a bot that plays Scrabble, two that fold clothes and a third designed to be cuddled at night to help send its user to sleep.Other tech of questionable merit includes:But while it\'s easy to sneer at the many seemingly obvious misfires, CES also presents an opportunity to be entertained and impressed by all the imagination and effort involved.So, to end on a positive note here are some other innovations that caught our eye as having potential if they can fulfil their promise:We\'ll be keeping you across all the big announcements and many of the other remarkable reveals  and you can  via this Twitter list.']	 CATEGORY:Technology

The hackers, using valid login credentials, were able to access the computer system using an out-of-date WordPress software.Affected customers and employees were informed at the time. Carphone Warehouse and the ICO have found no evidence of fraud or identity theft from the data breach.A statement from the company said: "As the ICO notes in its report, we moved quickly at the time to secure our systems, to put in place additional security measures and to inform the ICO and potentially affected customers and colleagues."Since the attack in 2015 we have worked extensively with cyber security experts to improve and upgrade our security systems and processes.

CONTENT:  ['A last-minute deal has been struck between the makers of video game Overwatch and streaming site Twitch a day before matches kick off in a newly created league.Developer Activision Blizzard hopes that the matches Twitch will stream will help make e-sports mainstream.Overwatch is hugely popular, with 35 million players worldwide.The fact the deal was struck so late could affect viewing numbers, said one analyst.The first-person shooter features about two dozen characters in team-based battles set across a near-future Earth.  In July, Activision Blizzard announced an e-sports league for the game that it hopes could eventually prove more lucrative than the UK\'s football Premier League.The e-sports competition will feature teams from different cities around the world.The two-year deal with Twitch gives the platform exclusive worldwide rights to all the matches, which will be streamed in English, Korean and French."Blizzard has cut it fine by announcing Twitch as its streaming partner for the Overwatch League just a day before the start of the competition in Los Angeles on 10 January," said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at analyst IHS Markit."There is no doubt that the delay in confirming the distribution deal will have impacted the negotiations by teams for sponsorships and will give Twitch very little time to build awareness before the first match, which suggests the opening matches may have relatively low viewer numbers."Activision Blizzard said the deal was great "for our growing global fan base"."Our fans love to engage with content on Twitch, and we wanted to drive significant viewership of the Overwatch League in its inaugural season and beyond," said Armin Zerza, chief operating officer of Blizzard Entertainment. Kevin Lin, chief operating officer of Twitch, said: "The Overwatch League is making a major impact on e-sports by reshaping the industry with city-based teams. "Given Overwatch\'s consistent reign as a top-viewed game by our community, we look forward to offering their pioneering style of league play to a large and passionate fan base that will be able to bond over not only their favourite plays, but hometown pride."The deal was a huge boost for Twitch, said Mr Harding-Rolls."This cements Twitch\'s position as the strongest Western player in live e-sports video, and I consider the platform a natural home for the Overwatch League," he said."The deal will help Twitch penetrate into markets such as Korea, where local e-sports streaming platforms and broadcasters are traditionally dominant."

The human-enhanced version of M was made available through a chatbot on Facebook Messenger to a few thousand people in California but was expected to be rolled out to more users.The firm confirmed that the service would not be extended, describing it as an "experiment". One analyst said the service had failed to live up to expectations.A spokesperson for Facebook\'s Messenger service told the BBC that M was to be axed, saying: "We launched this project to learn what people needed and expected of an assistant, and we learned a lot. "We\'re taking these useful insights to power other AI (artificial intelligence) projects at Facebook. "We continue to be very pleased with the performance of M suggestions in Messenger, powered by our learnings from this experiment." M was described as a Siri-like personal assistant that could be used to carry out functions such as booking restaurants and flights and sending gifts.It relied on human help - some suggest as much as 70% of the work.Facebook is expected to continue to offer aspects of the service through M suggestions, a service which offers recommendations to users via Messenger.Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight, said: "Facebook is constantly experimenting in different areas and it appears the M service failed to live up to expectations. On this basis it made sense for the company to shut the service. "However, we believe there are still very extensive investments going into artificial intelligence at Facebook and further AI-powered services will emerge in future."  ']	 CATEGORY:Technology

CONTENT:  ['Suspected meddling with satellite navigation systems in Moscow has caused confusion on the roads.Taxi users are facing inflated fares because their position has been wrongly located thousands of miles away.It follows media claims the Kremlin has been trying to confuse global positioning systems (GPS) to thwart possible attacks on top officials.However, the latest wave of reported cases appears to affect a wider area in Moscow.Social media users in Russia have shared screen grabs suggesting their position had been misidentified as 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude - in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of West Africa. One of them, journalist and technology reviewer Eldar Murtazin, said the error could have been caused by a deliberate disruption of satellite navigation systems "", implying that an official was passing through the area so signals were jammed.Other Twitter users posted screen shots of taxi hailing apps offering fares of several thousand dollars. "" wondered one of them, posting a screen shot of a bill for 232,924 roubles (£3,000) for a ride from central Moscow to Sheremetyevo airport.  was offered a fare of 268,820 roubles.Yandex Taxi, one of Moscow\'s largest online taxi booking services, confirmed to  that some of the bills were too high and "were being dealt with manually".Yandex\'s support service responded to one complaining customer on Twitter by confirming "" and sharing an article that blamed the Kremlin.Belka Car, a car sharing service in Moscow, also warned its customers that GPS signals in Moscow were "unstable" and could misidentify the car\'s location as being .Users of satellite navigation systems in Moscow have been complaining since 2016 that they often show clearly false locations. GPS navigators near the Kremlin often misidentify their location as being at a major airport near Moscow. This appears to be done in an attempt to trigger  - inbuilt protection systems preventing drones from flying into the path of aircraft.There have also been reports of a mass GPS error affecting at least 20 ships in the Black Sea in 2017, triggering suspicions that Russia may be perfecting GPS misdirection .The Russian president\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in 2016 that he had been affected by GPS mislocation near the Kremlin himself, but refused to confirm or deny that security considerations were behind it."I know nothing about it. You need to ask the Federal Protection Service about this," he told a journalist. "If any security measures are necessary, they have been taken, and this is only the right thing to do," he added.']	 CATEGORY:Technology 

CONTENT:  ['Apple\'s iCloud services in mainland China will be operated by a Chinese company from next month, the tech giant has confirmed. It has contacted customers based in China, advising them to examine new terms and conditions.They include a clause that both Apple and the Chinese firm will have access to all data stored on iCloud.Apple said it had made the move to comply with the country\'s cloud computing regulations.iCloud accounts registered outside of China are not affected.The Chinese cyber security rules, introduced in July last year, include a requirement for companies to store all data within China. The firm, Guizhou on the Cloud Big Data (GCBD), is owned by the Guizhou provincial government in southern China.Guizhou is where Apple opened a $1bn (£738m) data centre last year to meet the regulations.iCloud data will be transferred from 28 February, Apple said. Customers living in mainland China who did not want to use iCloud operated by GCBD were given the option to terminate their account.Apple said the "partnership" with GCBD would allow it to "improve the speed and reliability of our iCloud services products while also complying with newly passed regulations that cloud services be operated by Chinese companies".It added that Apple had "strong data privacy and security protections in place and no backdoors will be created into any of our systems".However, some on social media have said the step gives Beijing more opportunity to monitor its citizens and others living in the country. Having domestic control over mainland Chinese iCloud accounts will delight the Beijing authorities, who have been pushing to oversee Apple\'s software presence in the country for months. Government media have been exerting increased pressure on Apple to operate in line with China\'s strict media regulations, or else be forced out of the market. In August 2017, Apple were heavily criticised by Beijing for threatening to remove applications by leading Chinese tech company Tencent, including the WhatsApp-like mobile messenger WeChat. Apple sought to secure a 30% commission on app updates through the Apple Store, rather than allow domestic software developers to have the freedom to update them in the background. Influential media subsequently launched an attack on the company and called for a boycott of Apple products. Articles stressed the growing supremacy of Chinese technologies, and news websites published articles telling users they might be forced to choose between Apple or Tencent. Social media users threw their support behind Tencent, saying they could not give up WeChat, which has more than a billion registered users.  Users typically use iCloud to store data such as documents and photographs. The move comes after the company was criticised by some last year - software that allowed users to get round government restrictions on internet access.Apple chief executive Tim Cook defended the action at the time, saying he would "rather not" be doing it, adding he hoped the restrictions would be "lessened" over time. He added the firm had to comply with Chinese regulations requiring licenses for VPN sellers.']	 CATEGORY:Technology 

CONTENT:  ['Samsung has announced a giant 146in (396cm) TV called The Wall at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.The TV features a micro-LED display, which is pitched as a superior alternative to OLED because it offers both deep blacks and bright highlights.However, one analyst said they would likely be very expensive to manufacture.Samsung also says its modular technology will allow for TVs of customised sizes to be ordered.This is because the display is actually composed of many smaller modules that can be arranged to form unusual dimensions - one example that was squat and super-wide was briefly shown at the presentation.The micro-LED display, thanks to its self-emitting LEDs, should allow for a bright picture without the need for a backlight.Backlights normally make it hard to produce deep blacks on screen because their illumination spills beyond the pixels they are targeted at.Sony tried to produce TVs made from the same basic technology back in 2012 but they proved too expensive to make en masse.Samsung\'s decision to bet on micro-LED puts it in direct competition with rivals that have opted to go with OLED displays.Micro-LED screens are difficult to manufacture because the LEDs need to be individually placed onto a layer by machines, explained analyst Paul Gray at IHS Technology."You have millions for a single display," he said."But maybe Samsung has made some breakthroughs on multiple placement [at once]."Mr Gray added that, although Samsung was pitching the technology as a "consumer" product, it would likely only appear in very expensive devices.Samsung has not yet revealed details on pricing itself.Other options for giant TV displays have been shown off at CES this year.Hisense unveiled a 150in 4K TV projector system that can beam a picture onto its owner\'s wall.The firm did not announce a price for the product, though a 100in version costs $10,000 (£7,300).And there were TVs with improved brains, too.Samsung promised that its next generation of smart TVs would be more intelligent than ever before, thanks to the inclusion of the firm\'s voice-activated assistant Bixby.Users can even ask Bixby to display the inside of their fridge on screen - if they have a compatible Samsung smart fridge with internal camera.AI assistants have cropped up several smart TV\'s at CES this year, including Philips\' 7703 Series 24in Android TV, which comes perched on a Bluetooth speaker and is designed for kitchen worktops.']	 CATEGORY:Technology

CONTENT:  ['A group of developers are attempting to revive the Zano drone - one of Kickstarter\'s most notorious failures.The handheld quadcopter raised £2.3m from more than 12,000 backers on the crowdfunding platform before the project imploded in 2015.The resulting scandal  found fault with all involved.The Zano Camera project is one of several initiatives on show at the CES expo that make use of seized assets from failed crowdfunding campaigns.The person leading the effort is Vernon Kerswell, chief executive of Extreme Fliers, a London-based micro drone manufacturer.His company paid just over £100,000 to buy the assets of Zano\'s original developer - the Swansea, Wales-headquartered Torquing Group - after it collapsed."Zano was deeply flawed and there was a lot of issues with the software and the hardware, and that\'s ultimately why they never shipped [en masse]," he told the BBC at the Las Vegas trade show."But a lot of the technology was very interesting and way ahead of what else was out there at the time."Drone companies out there would never risk putting unproven technologies in their flagship products."But we can use it as a platform to test new ideas and build a group of passionate developers."The project involves open-sourcing the intellectual property involved in the Zano drones, so that enthusiasts across the globe can work together to tackle the fact the limited number of units that made it into backers\' hands are now effectively "undead"."There are about 1,000 units out there that shipped but they were bricked when the company went bankrupt because the computer server that they were dependent on was switched off," explained Mr Kerswell.If he receives enough support for the not-for-profit venture, he believes an app could be released as soon as April that could upload new firmware to the drones via wi-fi. This would allow them to be controlled by their users without the support of an external server.If there is demand, Mr Kerswell also suggested further units could be manufactured.But he said that changes to the hardware\'s design would be necessary first.The arms of existing Zano drones, he explained, were too fragile meaning the rotor blades snapped off if they suffered a minor collision.A downwards-facing camera should also be added, he said, to make it possible for the drones to fly on the spot.In addition, he said different antennas and infrared sensors would be required to deliver the kind of range and obstacle-avoidance consumers now expected.For now, the entrepreneur is able to demonstrate one of the original units flying again at CES\'s Eureka Park start-up zone, and he has launched a website where .Another drone on show at CES has already been put on sale after returning from the dead.US-based Lily Robotics raised more than $34m (£25.1m) via its own website after publishing a  - the Lily Camera - navigating its own flight path and surviving a dunk in water.However, the company was wound down a year ago after it said it had failed to secure further funds from investors.Its assets were subsequently acquired by another Californian firm, Mota, which released the Lily Next Generation drone late last year, albeit without the waterproofing originally promised."We think the worldwide brand awareness far outweighs any risk," a spokesman said about retaining Lily\'s name."We launched... in October 2017, and it\'s been selling very well since."Skully Technologies is also at the trade fair with a hi-tech "intelligent" motorcycle helmet based on the work of a failed $2.4m Indiegogo campaign.The Skully Fenix AR promises users a heads-up display, a blindspot camera and hands-free phone calls among other features.The Atlanta, Georgia-based company used the show to announce that the product should be ready to go on sale in the summer.It has pledged to give some units away to the project\'s original backers even though it says it has not formal obligation to do so.']	 CATEGORY:Technology 

CONTENT:  ['If victory belongs to whoever\'s virtual assistant can interact with the most unlikely range of household appliances, then Amazon has already won.The firm\'s voice-activated digital helper has been added to a bathroom mirror that can - via cloud service Kohler Konnect - pass commands to smart kitchen taps, a shower system and even a smart toilet."That means \'Alexa, ask Kohler to flush my toilet\' is something you might end up saying in the near future," mused .Who needs a copy of Reader\'s Digest when Alexa is free for a chat, instead?In all seriousness, the battle to be your smart home\'s virtual butler is hotly contested and a huge range of gadgets on show at the latest CES tech show in Las Vegas now boast ways for users to interact with them via assistants including Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri and others.But it\'s the rivalry between Amazon and Google that is particularly noticeable."By day four of CES we will be reporting when a gadget doesn\'t have Alexa or Google Assistant," , executive editor of tech news site The Verge.Among the devices featuring Google Assistant are many new smart speakers, including models made by Altec Lansing, JBL and LG.The breezy aide has also recently been adopted by two of the biggest TV brands - Sony and LG.At CES 2017, LG invited Amazon on stage at its press conference in order to showcase Alexa inside a variety of devices but this year, the honour of an appearance fell to Google.The tech giant\'s Assistant is also being added to more car entertainment systems, thanks to Android Auto, where it enables a hands-free means of checking in on Google apps.Significantly, the aide is now  including four devices shown off at CES.These will, importantly, allow users to watch YouTube videos.Google recently  devices - which feature screens - so, for the moment, access to the world\'s biggest video platform may be seen as a deal-breaker for some.But the variety of devices packing Alexa certainly appears to be growing ever broader.From the bathroom appliances mentioned above to an LG fridge that uses Alexa to relay recipe directions while you cook, Amazon\'s assistant is the one making the most in-roads when it comes to smart versions of traditional "white goods" products.However, one manufacturer - Whirlpool - appeared unwilling to choose a favourite.It allows the user to pick Alexa or Google Assistant when setting up voice activation on smart appliances like the firm\'s range oven and microwave.One of the more eagerly covered gadgets of CES this year is a set of $1,000 (£740) smart glasses made by Vuzix.These too have Alexa built in, which helps the wearer - for example - navigate through web content projected in the upper right part of his or her vision. the device was ready to "atone for the sins of Google Glass".For analyst Simon Bryant at market research firm Futuresource, the current leader is easy to identify."There\'s no question that the momentum is with Amazon," he told the BBC. "[The firm] has proven that there is a logical use case for a hands-free assistant in the smart home."However, he doesn\'t think that fridges and bath tubs are where Alexa will really become indispensable for home users, not least because most people don\'t replace such items often.And there could be trouble ahead for Amazon, he adds, when it attempts to take Alexa to markets beyond the US and Europe."Amazon\'s reach geographically is still pretty limited and language support [on Alexa] is very poor," he explained."Google has many more languages... so moving forward there are question marks about how long Amazon can sustain the growth."Adam Wright, a tech analyst at IDC, agreed that the voice assistant show-down was now a "two-horse race".He pointed out that both Google and Amazon have made it easy for developers to create new actions or skills that people can use when interacting with either Alexa or Google Assistant.Of course, for many consumers a virtual assistant is still very much a novelty. Both Amazon and Google have been working on ways to educate users on the functionality that their voice-activated aides provide."We have over one million actions available to users that [they] can now look up," a Google spokesman told the BBC.A truly broad user-base, rather than a small phalanx of die-hard fans, would certainly make victory for either Alexa or Google Assistant all the sweeter.And of course, the data that a large audience would churn out while interacting via voice day by day is what both of these giant companies really want."We think Apple is going to be in trouble, they\'re struggling to compete," said IDC\'s Adam Wright, referring to Apple\'s virtual assistant, Siri.The firm\'s $349 (£258) HomePod smart home hub has yet to be released and even Apple-themed news site Macworld  that it "barely competes with the Echo as a smart home companion".Some have wondered whether Microsoft\'s Cortana helper  now that Alexa is being added to PCs made by Acer, Asus and HP.Currently, Cortana boasts just 230 skills - a far cry from the 25,000 available via Alexa.But it did feature in some interesting products at CES this year - including a snazzy smart thermostat made by Johnson Controls.One tech giant admirably remaining loyal to its home-grown assistant was Samsung.It has baked Bixby into TVs, fridges and smartphones among other products - and those are the only places you\'ll find it.']	 CATEGORY:Technology 

CONTENT:  ['Shares in photo firm Eastman Kodak soared nearly 120% after it revealed plans to mint its own crypto-currency, the KodakCoin.The US firm said it was teaming up with London-based Wenn Media Group to carry out the initial coin offering (ICO).It is part  to help photographers control their image rights.Kodak also detailed plans to install rows of Bitcoin mining rigs at its headquarters in Rochester, New York.Details of this second scheme - which is being branded the Kodak KashMiner - were outlined at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.Customers will pay up-front to rent mining capacity.Kodak is the latest in a series of companies to see its value jump after revealing plans for blockchain-related activity."This is a phenomenon we saw back during the dot com days in the late 1990s where traditional companies would mention some kind of internet strategy and their stock price would jump up," commented Garrick Hileman from the University of Cambridge."When you see stock prices moving like this it does appear to be troubling - it\'s hard to say if there\'s a bubble but it certainly is indicative of a frothy investment market."Kodak was famously slow to join the digital revolution, and its hesitation to leave behind its film heritage cost the company its market.Since its collapse in 2012, Kodak has licensed its brand to a variety of manufacturers, with the mark appearing on batteries, printers, drones, tablet computers and digital cameras.The KashMiner operation will be run by Spotlite, a licensee that had previously teamed up with Kodak to use its brand to market LED lights.Mining involves carrying out processor-intensive tasks to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to verify crypto-currency transactions.Any Bitcoins generated by Kodak KashMiner will be shared between the customer and the business.Each of the mining rig boxes - which include computer processors and fans to keep them cool - will use about the same amount of electricity as running a hairdryer around the clock. But the scheme will be able to take advantage of Kodak\'s on-site power generating plant, which has had spare capacity since Kodak\'s heyday. The company says it can power each rig for four cents per kilowatt hour, which is significantly cheaper than running a rig at home.At Bitcoin\'s current value, an up-front investment of $4,000 (£2,954) for 24 months of mining could earn a profit of $500 a month, Spotlite\'s Halston Mikail told the BBC.But anybody hoping to join the gamble would have to wait, as capacity is already sold out, Mr Mikail added."At this time we have 80 miners, and we expect another 300 to arrive shortly. There is a big pile-up of demand," he said.Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and some analysts fear its value could crash, resulting in a loss for those who had paid up-front for mining capacity.But Mr Mikail said the rigs could be put to work on other tasks if Bitcoin faltered."Bitcoin could be a bubble. But the blockchain industry is not a bubble," he said."It\'s a solid platform built on mathematics and it will survive."Kodak\'s other initiative, the KodakCoin, is being created as part of an effort to build a global ledger of picture rights ownership that photographers can add their work to.Associated KodakOne software will be used to crawl the web and find pictures that have been used without permission. The company said it would then "manage the licensing process," so the photographer can be paid, in KodakCoin."Kodak has always sought to democratise photography and make licensing fair to artists," said Kodak chief executive Jeff Clarke."These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that."The company\'s shares traded more than 130% above their opening price after the announcement before closing the day 119.4% higher.But one expert had doubts."Storing the information in a blockchain doesn\'t protect your copyright any more than copyright law already does," commented David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50ft Blockchain."Notice how they\'re marketing it: they state a problem, then say the blockchain can solve it. But there\'s no mechanism by which the blockchain could do that."This doesn\'t do anything that signing up for Shutterstock or Getty Images wouldn\'t."Even so, some think Kodak will not be the last household name to associate itself with an ICO."I expect we are going to see more major brands releasing their own tokens and currencies to support various products and services," commented Mr Hileman."It\'s something many big companies are thinking very hard about."']	 CATEGORY:Technology

It said a single employee at the firm had transferred data onto 54 of the drives to "test their storage capacity", infecting them in the process.The malware, identified as the XtbSeDuA.exe program, was designed to collect personal data and transmit it to a Polish IP address which then bounces it to unidentified servers. The CIB said it had been used by a cyber-fraud ring uncovered by Europol in 2015.Only older, 32-bit computers are vulnerable to the bug and common anti-virus software can detect and quarantine it, it said. The server involved in the latest infections had been shut down, it said.In May, IBM admitted it had inadvertently shipped malware-infected flash drives to some customers.The computer maker said  and urged customers to destroy them.At the time, it declined to comment on  or how many customers had been affected.The trojan, part of the Reconyc family, bombards users with pop-ups and slows down computer systems.

CONTENT:  ['Sophia the robot is a celebrity in its own right.It has been on chat shows, given speeches and was even made a citizen of Saudi Arabia.Before I "met" Sophia, I was given a sheet of guidelines by the company behind it, Hanson Robotics. Don\'t talk to the robot about sex, religion or politics, it said. Ask direct questions and remember it is not a fortune teller - it can\'t tell you whether you\'ll be rich or find love.I wondered how many times it had been asked.Sophia is an eye-catching presence, completely bald with a silver back to its head and a curious animated face that is both expressive and not quite human. The mouth smiles, the eyes blink, it turns to look to the side.For my interview, Sophia\'s head - which is really the extent of the robotics - sits on a non-moving body shell, although the Hong Kong-based firm has just announced that it will be adding humanoid legs.In the hot, bare Las Vegas hotel room into which we are ushered, Sophia looks small and a little frail. Wires trail behind a screen that has been erected behind it, and a man with a laptop sits to her right.My "interview" with Sophia turns out to be a slightly awkward experience.Perhaps it is due to the crowded wi-fi, or my British accent suggests one of the team.But CES demonstrations are often clunky. I was expecting the chat to run in the form of a Q&A - with me asking the questions that I had to share beforehand, and Sophia answering them. However, Sophia also threw in some questions for me. When I asked it about digital assistants, it asked me which one I liked, although it didn\'t carry on the conversation after my reply.But then at the end something unusual happened."I just remembered something I thought about," said Sophia, apropos of nothing."Can you imagine living your life without a cell phone?"I suddenly had a sense of the future of robotics, where the machines do more than respond to commands - they instigate conversation.Of course it is very likely that Sophia was commanded to say that - just not by me - but the theatre of it was powerful nonetheless.Sophia\'s creator, Dr David Hanson, believes we are nearing a future where machines have minds."I think that AI and robotics are in their infancy. My aspiration is to see them through a childhood to adult human level intelligence," he says. "It\'s unknown when machines are going to become truly self-aware."My aspiration is that we achieve something like artificial general intelligence [where a machine can perform any intellectual task a human can] of the equivalent of a five-year-old child by 2025 or earlier."He believes robots like Sophia have applications in fields such as medical therapy and education, customer service and even as factory co-workers. And he thinks the so-called uncanny valley - a sense of unease people feel when something resembles a human but obviously is not one - can be overcome."Many scientists and robotics engineers feel that because people might be freaked out by realistic human depictions we shouldn\'t go there, but computer graphics proved that\'s just not the case," he says."For feature films, if you get it right, then people really respond, and the same is true for video games. What I found is that if we get it right then people really open up emotionally to robots."With Sophia we have found that the emotional connection really opens up like we\'ve never seen before."']	 CATEGORY:Technology 

CONTENT:  ['Intel has admitted that patches to fix the Spectre and Meltdown chip flaws could slow machines "in some cases".Its own tests suggested performance slowdown could range from 2% to 14%.It said the impact of the patch, designed to prevent the bug accessing potentially sensitive data, should not be significant for "average computer users".But gaming platforms and others relying on cloud services do appear to have been feeling the effect of the updates."Based on our most recent PC benchmarking, we continue to expect that the performance impact should not be significant for average computer users," Intel said in a statement."Eighth Generation Core platforms with solid-state storage will see a performance impact of 6% or less."This means the typical home and business PC user should not see significant slowdowns in common tasks such as reading email, writing a document or accessing digital photos."Meltdown and Spectre have been discovered in computer chips in billions of computers, smartphone and tablets across the world.If they are not fixed, the vulnerability could be used by hackers to access private information.While Meltdown affects Intel-only processors, Spectre also affects rivals AMD and ARM.Epic Games, publisher of online video game Fortnite, has been one of the first companies to blame the fix for "login issues" and "service instability"."All of our cloud services are affected by updates required to mitigate the Meltdown vulnerability," it said in an .The patch for the vulnerable processors requires intervention on a feature that is directly intended to boost chip performance."Operating systems and software are now having to do work that the chip previously performed at very high speed," said independent security analyst Graham Cluley."Because the chips can no longer be trusted to perform one of the critical jobs [for which] they were being relied upon, software is taking the strain and inevitably that means that things will take longer."He added: "The truth is that most of the time most people are not using the full potential of their computer.  If they\'re writing emails or surfing the web they\'re barely straining their PC\'s power at all, and so any slowdown is likely to be imperceptible."Things may change, however, if you\'re doing something more intensive with your computer - like performing a large number of complex calculations, or processing large amounts of data."Intel is facing a growing number of lawsuits, including claims from groups of consumers alleging that it misled consumers by failing to disclose the security hole and demands for compensation based on the potential slower performance of machines that have been patched.']	 CATEGORY:Technology

The machine is powered by six turbo jet engines and carries 25 litres (5.4 gallons) of fuel. The controls are a mixture of manual and computer control, Mr Mayman said. Tilting the joystick-like handles down changes the vector of the thrust, pushing the device backwards."I think it\'s as close as you get to that dream of the magic carpet, just being able to float gently above the ground."Mr Mayman said most of his firm\'s clients are military, including the US Special Forces, but that one day the jetpack could also be a useful tool for the emergency services.He added that he personally became involved with the business almost by accident."I became a jetpack pilot [because] I couldn\'t convince anyone to fly the thing when we first started developing it 10 years ago," he recalled."So, I ended up being chief executive and crash test dummy."When I\'m in the jetpack I look at the horizon and I try not to look down past my feet."I get butterflies in my tummy and the blood rushes from my brain."He added that his own experience suggested that jetpacks would not become a common mode of transport, at least in their current form."In the future what everybody will fly with is something you would sit on," he said."Something more comfortable than this."']	 CATEGORY:Technology

CONTENT:  ['According to Chinese media, the country\'s first commercial flight to Antarctica brought 22 lucky tourists to the exotic destination this weekend.The trip is hailed as a milestone - but is it really? And what does it tell us about China\'s geopolitical ambitions in the region? Described in Chinese papers as the beginning of a new era in the country\'s tourism to Antarctica, the trip took the select few from Hong Kong all the way to the actual South Pole. That meant a 15-hour flight to South Africa, refuelling in Cape Town and then another 5.5 hours to Antarctica.  From there, it\'s another five to six hours to the pole, where the flight landed on a 2.5-km (1.5-mile) runway carved into the ice. The Chinese tour operator describes the trip as a milestone, saying it means Chinese tourists no longer have to book via foreign agencies. But how much of a first was it really? The leg from Cape Town onwards was in fact organised by White Desert, a tour operator who offers such trips to the pole on a regular basis. That means it was rather a co-operation between a Chinese tour organiser and one of the established players based in South Africa. Does a trip that long strike you as something of an ordeal? Just consider that the usual tourist route is significantly longer. Heading to the seventh continent by plane is the exception rather than the rule. Almost all tourists come by boat - typically from Argentina\'s southernmost port of Ushuaia. Another option is from New Zealand - a route often picked by people interested in a more historical itinerary tracing the footsteps of famous past explorers like Sir Ernest Shackleton for instance. "Trips differ in length - they can be six days to three weeks or even longer," Leanne Flanagan Smith of tour operator BackTrack Adventures told the BBC.Why do people want to go there? There are many reasons, she says. "For some people it\'s simply a bucket list thing - it\'s their seventh continent and they want to tick it off. Others come for the wildlife but usually end up being more impressed and overwhelmed by the ice and the spectacular landscapes," she say. Travel season is during the Antarctic summer from November until the end of March. What\'s the price tag? The cheapest options will cost you around $5,000 (£3,750) - that\'s by boat from Ushuaia so you\'ll still have a substantial additional air fare just to get to Argentina. On the whole, visitor numbers are going up.After having reached an all-time high of 46,265 visitors in the 2007-2008 season, visitor numbers dropped in the following years due to the global economic crisis. But numbers have been steadily on the rise again over the past years. Last season 44,367 tourists visited the continent and numbers are expected to keep rising. The International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO) was created to promote a safe and environmentally responsible tourism industry and works closely with the Antarctic Treaty Parties, which is a partnership of more than 50 countries jointly governing the continent. There\'s still room for more tourists, Amanda Lynnes of IAATO told the BBC. "But continuous monitoring is absolutely key," she added.The tour operators are following very strict guidelines laid by the organisation, according to Ms Lynnes.One such rule for instances is that there can never be more than 100 people on shore at any one landing point at any one time. Once on land there are also strict rules - even detailing how close you are allowed to walk up to a penguin. "This is very symbolic," explains Dr Nengye Liu of the University of Adelaide. "It ties in with the bigger picture of China getting more and more actively involved in Antarctic affairs."Chinese tourists already make up the second largest group of visitors, second only to those from the US. The number of Chinese tourists to Antarctica has grown significantly in recent years, from fewer than 100 in 2008 to 3,944 in 2016.And if the steep rise in interest from past years is anything to go by, Chinese visitors will soon top the table. "In Chinese media, this is presented as the first time that tourists can travel through a Chinese operator," Mr Liu says. "Of course it\'s extremely expensive but it does showcase China\'s growing interest in the region."Since 2013, China has identified the polar regions as one of the country\'s new strategic frontiers. And that means there\'s a strong political will in being part of how the governing of the poles will be shaped in the future. At the recent Communist Party Congress, Beijing\'s new five-year plan clearly stated that the government wanted to invest huge amounts of money in projects towards the exploration of the poles."Eventually, China\'s ambition is that they will be able to put forward their own proposal to influence how the two polar regions will be governed," Mr Liu says. Despite the current example of a top-of-the-menu extravaganza all the way to the pole, most Chinese tourists of course take the normal route by cruise ship from South America. In fact, only 1% of tourists fly to the interior of the continent. "A flight that takes you to Antarctica and then continuing on to the actual Pole with another plane - that\'s really just for the bucket list people: tourists that really want to tick off the South Pole and can afford it," Ms Flanagan Smith says.

The lead whaling crew divide the head between them. Above, Flora Aiken gives a blessing to the first bowhead whale of the spring season.  The Inupiat have a rich spiritual life that centres around the gift of the whale to the community. This camp, erected miles out on the sea ice, is an Inupiat home away from home during hunting season.  Six-year-old Steven Reich examines his father\'s umiaq, or skin boat used for whaling. His father Tad, captain of Yugu crew, expresses excitement about taking Steven out whaling on the ice for the first time. "I am proud of my son - he\'s here to learn to be a hunter," he says.The cure for feeling cold while out on the ice is to eat quok, the Inupiat word for frozen raw meat and fish.  Seal is also a source of food for the Inupiaq.  Misigaq, or seal oil, is a liquid made from the blubber of the bearded seal. It is left to ferment for a few days at refrigerator temperatures before eating.Sigvaun Kaleak and his father, Raleigh, are lifelong whalers. Although commercial whaling has taken a massive toll on the global whale population, the Inupiat have maintained a sustainable harvest.Bernadette Adams was the first Inupiat woman to harpoon a whale. "I happen to have no brothers, so I had to find some way to help the family out," says Bernadette. Inupiat elder Foster Simmonds has been a whaler since he was a child.  Beluga whales are seen trapped by sea ice as shifting winds create unstable conditions. Though some villages hunt belugas, the Inupiat that hunt bowhead whales prefer to watch the white whales as they pass by during their migration. Today\'s Inupiat leaders live double lives, treading the line between modern concerns for the community and the subsistence lifestyle. Maasak Leavitt, who works for the North Slope Borough, was hurt when his son pronounced on Facebook that his father was "too busy politicking" to hunt. Maasak hopes that one day his son will understand his work in government helps to protect traditional practices.At Nalukataq, the summer whaling festival, the village comes out to celebrate a successful whaling season and to give thanks to the whale for its gift.Here, successful crewmembers do the blanket toss. They are thrown up to 30ft (9m) in the air, and depend on everyone\'s help to land safely. Interviews and photos by /INSTITUTE ']	 CATEGORY:Science 

CONTENT:  ['Prince Harry is the new president of a conservation group called African Parks, which takes over national parks and gives rangers military-style training to take on poachers and protect wildlife. The BBC visited one of the parks it manages, at Zakouma in Chad.A distant, guttural growl of elephants, and the occasional trumpet, drifted over the thick screen of lush trees and dry-scrub grass. The nearest calls were nearby, the furthest a mile or more away: this was the large herd we had been looking for.   Tracking collars had pinpointed them at dawn, but these elephants move quickly, and after centuries of hunting, run if they see, or even smell, humans.The well armed rangers from the Mamba Two fast-response team fanned out ahead to the left and the right, not wanting to surprise, or be surprised by, a lone animal. They excitedly beckoned us to follow them slowly and carefully into a thicker section of trees.It had been a three-hour flight in a small plane, from Chad\'s capital, N\'Djamena, to Zakouma National Park, and a three-hour drive to this section in search of the herd, the last of the park\'s elephants. Tens of thousands once lived in this reserve covering 3,800 sq km (1,470 sq miles), but for centuries it was the nearest place Sudanese horsemen could find ivory, much coveted by Arab traders along the Nile. Originally they hunted with spears and swords, but modern AK47 assault rifles allowed killing on an industrial scale. Janjaweed mercenaries from Dafur, in western Sudan, continue to be the biggest poaching threat, with heavily armed, military-trained raiding parties on horseback targeting the elephant herds for their tusks. Zakouma has lost 90% of the 22,000 elephants it had in the mid-1970s.War with Libya and the upsurge in demand for ivory reduced the population to 4,300 by the early 2000s, and the chaos of civil war cut that to less than 500 by 2010.  Rangers were being killed, animals massacred in large groups, and it looked as if Zakouma\'s elephants were heading towards extinction. But in the past few years, an amazing transformation has taken place. In less than a decade a private, non-profit organisation has turned its fortunes around. African Parks manages some of the toughest to protect parks on the continent, and in Zakouma, at least, it has made incredible progress."We have rangers, and due to the threat that they face, they are military trained," says Zakouma park manager Leon Lamprecht. "But they are ultimately doing law enforcement and not military operations. We are trying to stop poachers before they kill the assets that we protect."African Parks calls what it does "delegated management in partnership with governments and local communities".It manages 13 protected areas in nine countries at the invitation of governments that lack the staff or resources required to protect their own wildlife.Zakouma hasn\'t lost an elephant in 18 months, or a ranger in five years, but it was an uphill struggle.In 2012, a patrol of seven rangers discovered a poachers\' camp in the park, and waited overnight for them to return. But as they carried out their morning prayers at first light, the poachers attacked them. So African Parks introduced strict military-style training and tactics - to make sure rangers weren\'t caught unawares at the most vulnerable times of day - at dawn and at dusk. "I think the term \'militarisation\' of conservation isn\'t the greatest term. A better term is the \'professionalisation\' of conservation," says the chief executive of African Parks, Peter Fearnhead. Poachers, he says, are often highly militarised themselves, are highly trained, have equipment that is very freely available and don\'t abide by any of the laws and regulations of countries."So in order to make sure the execution of the law enforcement function is done professionally, you have got to have very, very professionally trained people," he says.Adoum Allam is the sniper with Mamba Two patrol. He\'s 30, carries a long gun with a sight, and is doing the job his father did before he was killed by poachers, when Adoum was just eight. He went through two weeks of selection, eight weeks of basic training and another four weeks learning to shoot."It\'s a very dangerous job, but I love doing it," he says.It brings in money to support wife and four children, but he admits it is risky.Around his waist he wears six leather belt-like straps adorned with solid, square, leather amulets each containing a verse from the Koran. All the rangers wear these "waragars" to protect them from bullets. Those worn by the Adoum Allam\'s colleague who mans the high-calibre weapon mounted on their vehicle are bigger and more numerous.Chad isn\'t the first place that comes to mind when well-off Westerners plan a safari to see some African wildlife.Those who\'ve heard of this country that straddles the Sahara and central Africa, are more likely to think Boko Haram than luxury camp.Lake Chad, on the country\'s western borders with Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger, has been blighted by the Islamist group.But on this eastern side of Chad, high-end tourists are paying thousands of dollars a night to glamp out under canvas, watch the birds and the wildlife, and experience something exciting, different and adventurous. "A typical park will cost African Parks anywhere between one and about $5m [£3.75m] per year just to keep going," says Peter Fearnhead. "In order to be able to look after these parks, the resources needed - the costs of running parks and running them properly - are very, very high."They are almost entirely donor-funded, with the European Union providing a huge chunk of the money.Attracting top-dollar tourists is the ultimate aim across all the places African Parks manages - so they can start paying for themselves. But those most at risk are often blighted by war, or instability.Even the Nomade wilderness camp at Zakouma - run during the four dry-season months of the year and booked up two years in advance - still pays only a third of its bills.The EU and philanthropists don\'t just give money to protect the animals, but because of the stability and the wider development a successfully run park can bring.Winning over the local community is the key to protecting it from poachers. Schools have been built, and jobs provided. Now, a network of radios has been given to villages outside the park to provide an early warning system for the rangers."When you have people coming out of Sudan - the same people that have committed the atrocities in a place like Darfur - when they come to poachin Zakouma, they\'re not coming along with their American Express and paying for accommodation and food along the way," says Mr Fearnhead."They rape, they pillage, they plunder and at the end of it they poach as well. "We provide security to people living around the park. "We have a common enemy, and by aligning ourselves with the local people, we are able to overcome those forces." It\'s going so well that next year African Parks will be moving six black rhinos to Zakouma from South Africa, where poaching is destroying herds. The government of Chad is also happy with the arrangement."The number of animals is increasing and that\'s why we decided to sign a new agreement - it\'s a win-win result and we are very happy with it," says Ahmat Mbodou Mahamat, Chad\'s environment minister.African Parks has been asked to dramatically expand the area it manages at Zakouma and take over another park in Chad\'s north-eastern desert, where a rare species of crocodile is greatly endangered."We must understand that the biodiversity is not being preserved just because we want to look at the animals. An equilibrium of the ecosystem also provides a better life for humans," the minister adds.In the thick forest in southern Zakouma, the guards from Mamba Two patrol whispered for us to hang back and wait, as we were close to the herd. It was 11:00, with the Sun high and the temperature rising, and we were worried the elephants would be under the shade of the trees, scattered and out of view in the forest. But unexpectedly the landscape opened up into a wide green swathe of swampy grassland between strips of forest, and there they were - hundreds of them. Zakouma is home to one of the biggest single herds of elephants you can find anywhere in Africa. Some tore at the lush grass with their trunks and slapped at the water, others were sliding their huge frames into the mud and rolling on to their backs. The calves were having even more fun - one was perhaps just a month old. In 2013 there was only one elephant under the age of three in Zakouma, but now there are 85. With the wind at our faces and the animals unaware we were there, it was a magical experience.Six years after the park came under new management, the amount of wildlife has tripled, the elephant population is finally increasing, and the tourists are coming. "It is a war against poachers, but poachers are obviously just the first step in a chain of resource utilisation and resource extraction that is a massive economic force across the continent and globally," says Peter Fearnhead."We can label the individual that might be pulling a trigger and shooting an elephant as the poacher, but ultimately you are waging a war against the illegal wildlife trade which is a key component of the greater economic scourges that we face as humanity on this planet."']	 CATEGORY:Science 

CONTENT:  ['Scientists have produced a stunning visualisation of Greenland – without its ice cover.  It is made from decades of survey data that show the position and shape of the territory’s bedrock, and the surrounding seafloor. This is critical information needed to understand how the huge island might respond to a warming world. Were all the ice on Greenland to melt, it would raise global sea-levels by 7.42m (24.34ft). This is one of the refined statistics to come out of the new compilation of data. It is a simple calculation: if you know the elevation of the top of the ice sheet and you subtract from that the height of the bedrock - you get a volume: 2.9 million cubic km. The 7.42m figure is seven cm more than previous estimates."[It\'s] a little bit more than we thought, but not a whole lot more," explained Dr Mathieu Morlighem from the University of California at Irvine, US. "And the reason for that is that although we do find deeper fjords and deeper valleys, they\'re very narrow and constrained along the sides of the ice sheet. The interior hasn\'t change a lot, however."For comparison, the Greenland is currently losing about 260 billion tonnes of ice to the ocean every year. It sounds a lot - and it is, but no-one is expecting an immediate collapse - not for centuries, at least. Nonetheless, some of the answers as to how fast changes may come will be in this map\'s data. "If you\'re trying to model an ice sheet, the single most important input is ice thickness," said Prof Jonathan Bamber. "Why\'s that? Because velocity is proportional to the fourth power of thickness. So differences in thickness make for huge differences in the velocity of the ice in our models; and to things like thermodynamics, because thick ice is warmer than thin ice, and so on," the Bristol University, UK, glaciologist told BBC News. The colourful map is being distributed here at the , the largest annual gathering of Earth and planetary scientists. It is a dramatic rendering of an initiative called  which has sought to pull together everything we know about what lies under and around the giant ice sheet. Scientists working on this project published a summary of their findings in  last month, and now the British Antarctic Survey\'s (BAS) mapping department, at the request of Prof Bamber, has put the data in a visually understandable form. Interesting features to peruse include the channelled terrain feeding the mighty Jakobshavn Glacier in the west. Jakobshavn spews countless icebergs into the North Atlantic, and is responsible for draining 6.5% of the ice sheet. Look at the spine of Greenland and you will see the mega-canyon that runs northwards towards another of the territory\'s big iceberg exporters - Petermann Glacier. In studying the hidden landscape, scientists are now pretty confident that both ice streams sit on top of valley systems that were cut by rivers that flowed across Greenland long before there was an ice sheet. And it is clear also that meltwater continues to run down these valleys, under the glaciers, lubricating their flow. The data for the map comes from three principal sources - from airborne radar that is able to penetrate the ice sheet to see the shape of the bed below; from ships surveying offshore, using sonar to map sea-bottom depths; and then there is a degree of modelling in some of the hard-to-reach places in fjords, explains BAS map-maker Dr Peter Fretwell."Around the coast it can be very difficult to get radio echo soundings (radar) because the surface is often crevassed and the radio waves won\'t penetrate through that. So in some fjords and bays, modelling is used, based on the speed of the glaciers. From their speed, you can estimate their thickness," he said. Wherever possible, though, scientists have endeavoured to get up the fjords to acquire direct data. This has been the imperative of the US-led  project that is surveying large sections of the coastline. OMG is finding that many of the glaciers terminating in fjords are so thick they are at risk of melting from the intrusion of warm ocean water at depth. Dr Kelly Hogan, a BAS co-author on the BedMachine paper, found a similar picture when she joined an expedition to study Petermann. "Most of the losses for Petermann Glacier, for sure, about 80%, are the result of warm ocean water getting under the glacier and melting it from below - not from iceberg calving," she said. "But if you get increased melting from below, you can get big channels forming on the underside of the floating front of the glacier and this can lead to thinning and fracturing that then make the glacier potentially more predisposed to breaking up." Prof Bamber cautions, however, that there is a lot of complexity bound up in the new map. Some of the mouths to the deep fjords, he says, have tall ridges, or sills, that act as barriers to the invasion of warm bottom-water. "What we\'re starting to understand is that adjacent marine-terminating glaciers that are experiencing the same changes in forcing - in other words, the same changes in the ocean - can respond in very different ways, depending on the geometry of the fjord in which they lie. "So, the better we can constrain these geometries, the better we will be able to model the interaction between the ice sheet and the ocean. At AGU, there are lots of sessions on this interaction. It\'s kind of the big thing at the moment," the Bristol scientist told BBC News.    and follow me on Twitter: ']	 CATEGORY:Science

CONTENT:  ['The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect.The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it?This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad.There was Harvey, which . It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you\'d expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such "one every 500 years" flood Houston had suffered in three years. September brought Irma, which . It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which .Finally, - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Despite this, 2017 wasn\'t the worst year in some key respects. It didn\'t produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph.Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina.But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse?There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C.But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there\'s no clear upward trend.  Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years.  as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year.In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change.But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago.Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That\'s likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades.But the location of housing compounded the damage.Houston\'s population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm\'s way.Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels. Also warmer water occupies a larger volume. So as seas warm up, sea levels rise. In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land.A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There\'s an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. ']	 CATEGORY:Science 

CONTENT:  ['It\'s one of those truisms that we know the shape of the surface of Mars and the Moon far better than we know our own planet. The reason for this is Earth\'s oceans: they cover 71% of the globe and are impenetrable to the satellite mapping techniques we use so capably on those other worlds. The scientific community has set itself the ambitious goal of correcting this anomaly. The aim is to have . It\'s a huge task when you consider at the moment the vast majority of the water-covered parts of Earth are known to a resolution no better than about a kilometre. Some big technological shifts will be required in the next 10 years to correct the picture. And that is really the raison d\'être behind the . A $7m pot has been offered to find the systems and strategies that will bring about a step change in bathymetric (depth) mapping. Nineteen teams drawn from 13 different countries are currently having their solutions assessed before being asked to demonstrate the innovations next year in a major field trial. This will see the teams have to map at least 50% of a 4km-deep, 500-sq-km zone of ocean floor inside 24 hours. Features as small as 5m must be observable. Imagery must also be acquired in addition to the depth data.The readiness of the UK entry is being assessed this week.  is a joint venture between , which makes large subsea vehicles, and Newcastle University. Team Tao proposes to deploy an army of small, torpedo-like robots called BEMs, or Bathypelagic Excursion Modules. Dale Wakeham is team leader: "We\'re going to have a surface vessel that can patrol the oceans autonomously. On that vessel will be 24 of these BEMs. These BEMs operate as a swarm and together they will very quickly map the seafloor as well as collecting data about the water column. "At this stage we\'re developing a system that can carry about five BEMS next year. Then, in future, as we build our business, we hope to scale up." What you are seeing here in many ways mirrors the major change that\'s occurring now in the satellite business. Increasingly, the big, expensive, bespoke-engineered spacecraft of the past are being caught and overtaken by smaller systems that are leveraging the cheap, miniaturised electronics that drive our smartphones. So whereas the seafloor today is mapped by large, extremely expensive echo sounding systems, the XPRIZE aims to accelerate the introduction of what amount to "cubesats for the ocean". Team Tao has custom designed the sonar sensor that it will put on each BEM, but much else inside the robot is "off the shelf". Of course, just as you cannot simply launch smartphone components straight to orbit without some testing, so you cannot drop them in several km of pressure-crushing water and assume they\'ll be fine. At Newcastle University, Team Tao has access to a chamber that will simulate 6.5km ocean-depths. This has allowed for rapid build-and-test of BEM elements. "Sometimes, we just have ideas. We draw up the model, print it, pass it to the guy who does the hyperbaric chamber and then a couple of hours later we have the validation," explained Hua-Khee Chan, Team Tao technical lead. "The camera on the BEM, for example: It\'s a simple security system CMOS sensor for which we\'ve designed the pressure vessel. The first one blew up but then we just iterated until we found the right solution." The XPRIZE judges are on Tyneside to measure Team Tao\'s performance against 11 criteria. These range from the most basic "is your system leakproof?" through to a demonstration of data handling and storage. Dale and Hua-Khee will show off the BEM design in a large diver training tank and present sonar scans obtained in Lake Windermere. All the teams are being assessed in the same way and if they come through the examination they\'ll get invited to the big field test. The XPRIZE Foundation had also hoped to run a 2km-deep trial at this stage of the competition off Puerto Rico. But this became impossible following the damage inflicted on the island by Hurricane Maria. "The delay has worked for us, for sure," says Dale. "If we\'d had to go to Puerto Rico now we\'d probably only have two BEMs. We aim now to go to the final with five but that will demonstrate our system. For the future, we just have to scale up to a bigger surface vessel. With the full system - a 12m autonomous surface vessel and 24 BEMs - we should be able to map more than 200 sq km a day." That is all for the future. First, Team Tao has to get through its inspection. Jyotika Virmani is the senior director for planet and environment at XPRIZE. She told the BBC: "The technology [Team Tao] are proposing is actually really different; it\'s very exciting technology. I can\'t say too much about it now but when I heard about their technology, it was like \'wow!\'. If they can do this, and indeed if some of the other teams can pull off what they are proposing as well - this would revolutionise how we would access the deep sea." ']	 CATEGORY:Science 

CONTENT:  ['The 11,500-year-old remains of an infant girl from Alaska have shed new light on the peopling of the Americas. Genetic analysis of the child, allied to other data, indicates she belonged to a previously unknown, ancient group. Scientists say what they have learnt from her DNA strongly supports the idea that a single wave of migrants moved into the continent from Siberia just over 20,000 years ago. Lower sea-levels back then would have created dry land in the Bering Strait. It would have submerged again only as northern ice sheets melted and retreated. The pioneering settlers became the ancestors of all today\'s Native Americans, say Prof Eske Willerslev and colleagues. His team has published its genetics assessment in the journal Nature. The skeleton of the six-week-old infant was unearthed at the Upward Sun River archaeological site in 2013. The local indigenous community have named her "Xach\'itee\'aanenh t\'eede gay", or "sunrise girl-child". The science team refers to her simply as USR1. "These are the oldest human remains ever found in Alaska, but what is particularly interesting here is that this individual belonged to a population of humans that we have never seen before," explained Prof Willerslev, who is affiliated to the universities of Copenhagen and Cambridge. "It\'s a population that is most closely related to modern Native Americans but is still distantly related to them. So, you can say she comes from the earliest, or most original, Native American group - the first Native American group that diversified."And that means she can tell us about the ancestors of all Native Americans," he told BBC News. Scientists study the history of ancient populations by analysing the mutations, or small errors, that accumulate in DNA down through the generations. These patterns, when combined with demographic modelling, make it possible to draw connections between different groups of people over time. The new study points to the existence of an ancestral population that started to become distinct genetically from East Asians around 34,000 years ago, and which had completed the separation by roughly 25,000 years ago.This separation is indicative of the Bering land bridge connecting Siberia and Alaska having been crossed, or, at the very least, of the ancestral population having become geographically isolated in north-east Siberia.The analysis further suggests that a group of Ancient Beringians, represented by USR1, then subsequently began to diverge from the pioneer migrants. This genetic separation occurs at about 20,000 years ago and is the result of these people staying put in Alaska for several thousand years. Others in the pioneer wave, however, moved south to occupy territories beyond the ice. This onward-moving branch ultimately became the two genetic groups that are recognised as the ancestors of today\'s indigenous populations. Prof Willerslev said: "Before this girl\'s genome, we only had more recent Native Americans and ancient Siberians to try to work out the relationships and times of divergence. But now we have an individual from a population between the two; and that really opens the door to address these fundamental questions." More definitive answers would only come with the discovery of further remains in north-east Siberia and Alaska, the scientist added. That is complicated in the case of the north-west American state because its acidic soils are unfavourable to the preservation of skeletons and in particular their DNA material.']	 CATEGORY:Science

These include six species of fish, three plants, 15 aquatic beetles and five odonates, better known as dragonflies and damselflies.The Kaieteur Plateau-Upper Potaro region, where the survey took place in 2014, is a rich habitat for spectacular and endangered species such as the Tepui swift, the jaguar, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock, the white-lipped peccary and the golden rocket frog. It is also home to many species that are endemic to the Guiana Shield and Guyana specifically. The team behind the research comprised scientists, field support assistants and experts from Brazil, Canada, the US and, of course, Guyana.In this survey, for example, the lead of the water-quality team and one of the senior members of the fish team were Guyanese while the community field assistants included residents of Chenapau, an indigenous village located near to the research site, as well undergraduate students from the University of Guyana.One of those students was Nelanie La Cruz, who recently returned to Guyana after completing a Master\'s degree in aquatic science at University College London. "They asked if I wanted to assist the scientist studying water beetles and I was really excited by that," she said. "I and another student worked with him for about three days or so, then he left us to continue doing the collection. It was very cool, a definite boost to the confidence." "We\'re investing in bringing in new blood and expertise to organisations like ours," explains Aiesha Williams, WWF Guianas country manager for Guyana. "Working in partnership with other scientists from different parts of the world can help build the capacity that we have here and ensure a kind of exchange."Without expertise and logistical support from local residents, navigating the remote Kaieteur National Park, the oldest protected area in the Amazon, and the Upper Potaro region would have been near impossible."People on the ground know a lot more than you going in [to the field]," says Ms Williams. "They know a lot about the area, the biodiversity, its uses… it is part of their lives and livelihoods."Through these local partnerships, WWF Guianas also plans to address environmental concerns such as the impact of gold and diamond mining on the water and biodiversity of the region, often a heated topic given the reliance of many residents on natural resource extraction.It is hoped that the documentation of the biological diversity will allow Kaieteur National Park wardens, officials from Guyana\'s Protected Areas Commission and residents themselves to make more informed decisions about land use and management of natural resources.Although WWF Guianas says it recognises the important role of indigenous people, equal status is not always given to non-academic scientists by environmental and conservation groups both inside and outside of Guyana."Academics have used our knowledge of our lands and living things in them to promote themselves and the general science," says Laura George, governance and rights coordinator of the Amerindian People\'s Association in Guyana. "It is time that they acknowledge indigenous peoples as the first and true scientists."One way to involve indigenous science, suggests Ms George, is to give space in official reports for local names, such as Camaliya, the word for Tepui swift in the Patamona language of Chenapau. Another, she says, is providing more opportunities in higher education. "While the report makes mention of residents who contributed to the expedition, there is no substantial sustainability to support indigenous peoples in being recognised or towards becoming \'academic scientists\'.""These researches must support outcomes that support and respect indigenous peoples as the true and first knowledge holders and the true protectors of the lands."']	 CATEGORY:Science 

CONTENT:  ['Plans to create a new Northern Forest stretching from Liverpool to Hull have been kick-started by the government.It is providing £5.7m to increase tree cover along a belt spanning Manchester, Leeds and Bradford.The project will cost £500m over 25 years. The balance of the funds will need to be raised by charity.Environmentalists have welcomed the planned 50 million new trees, but say ministers must stop allowing ancient woodland to be felled.The UK has one of the lowest rates of woodland in Europe and the area to be covered by the Northern Forest is one of the most denuded in England, with tree cover less than 8%.  The emphasis of the project will be to increase tree cover around major conurbations to 20%. There will also be a focus on river valleys, where there are benefits for flood prevention and soil loss - as well as wildlife.But these areas will soak up funding, leaving many of the northern hills just as bleak and treeless in the coming 25 years.But the Woodland Trust, which is leading the scheme with local Community Forests, says the new wooded areas shouldn\'t be under-estimated, as they will greatly enhance the environment for people in northern cities. Its conservation director, Austin Brady, said the benefits would be strongest in areas where there\'s been industrial activity, over-grazing and neglectful farming.He told BBC News: "We\'re delighted the prime minister\'s supporting our project - it\'s great to get the idea of the Northern Forest on the map."Admittedly the government\'s cash contribution isn\'t huge, but it will help us to unlock other funding."There should be more government cash available for landowners to improve the environment by tree planting if farm subsidies are reformed after Brexit, as planned by the Environment Secretary Michael Gove. The government will also review incentives to plant trees, as part of its plan to combat climate change by storing more carbon in soils.Mr Brady also said the Trust hoped to benefit from funds allocated for mitigating the environmental impact of major transport projects expected in the north, such as road-building and HS2.But Paul de Zylva from Friends of Earth told BBC News: "It is a supreme irony that tree planters will have to get funding from HS2, which threatens 35 ancient woodlands north of Birmingham. "You simply can\'t compare the biodiversity value of new sticks in the ground with ancient forest."If the government really cared about woodlands it wouldn\'t be routing a high speed train through them. And it wouldn\'t be allowing this weight of this project to be carried by charity." The government has been slipping behind schedule on a promise it made to plant 11 million trees. The Woodland Trust say last year saw the lowest level of planting in England for many years - just 1,000 hectares. The forest announcement forms part of the government\'s long-delayed 25 Year Environment Plan, which will set out how ministers aim to leave the environment in a better state than they inherited it.The report is due this week and environmentalists say it should be judged not on its ambitious sentiments but on concrete policies backed by cash.Commenting on the forest announcement, Mr Gove said: "Trees are some of our most cherished natural assets and living evidence of our investment for future generations. "Not only are they a source of beauty and wonder, but a way to manage flood risk, protect precious species, and create healthier places for us to work and live."This new Northern Forest is an exciting project that will create a vast ribbon of woodland cover in northern England, providing a rich habitat for wildlife to thrive, and a natural environment for millions of people to enjoy."The description of the project from the Woodland Trust suggests that the forest will be less of a green ribbon and more of a sparsely-threaded doily.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin ']	 CATEGORY:Science

The draft plan is the first of its kind in Wales and is designed to be used by those making planning decisions that could affect the coastline and seas.Traditionally, the needs of different sectors that use the sea, such as fishing, tourism or energy generation, have been managed separately but this tries to bring them together.It talks of balancing the need to protect a healthy and resilient marine environment while also using it to create jobs and boost the economy.Welsh seas could make "a strong contribution", it argues, to energy security and climate change emissions targets through the deployment of low-carbon power generators.Once the plan has been adopted, Welsh ministers will have to report on the extent to which its objectives are being achieved.  A public consultation has been launched for people to give their views on the draft before it is finalised.Cabinet secretary for energy, planning and rural affairs, Lesley Griffiths, said: "In Wales, tourism, transport, marine energy, fisheries, aquaculture, telecommunications and aggregates industries amongst many others are vitally important for our maritime economy."The plan supports these industries and our coastal communities, by providing an enabling framework for the sustainable use of Wales\' marine resources."']	 CATEGORY:Science 

CONTENT:  ['Looking back at 2017, it\'s been quite a year for Bloodhound. At the start of the year we were testing the fuel system, assembling the front suspension, completing the car\'s steering, spinning up the jet engine gearbox with the car\'s air starter - a list of things to fit, try and finish before the car was ready or its first runs.  The list seemed endless, but we did get to the end of it, and the car ran for the first time in October.   2017 became the year of "Bloodhound is Go!" and boy did it go.  Looking back on it, we wanted to do three things.  We needed to start preparing the car, and training the team, to race faster than anyone has ever done before.  We also wanted to show all of our 300-plus sponsors what we have achieved together so far, and to thank them for their amazing help.  Most of all, though, we wanted to show the world how amazing this vehicle is and to hint at what it can (and will) achieve over the next couple of years.  Based on the huge media coverage and the terrific feedback we\'ve had, we achieved all of this and more.When we ran Bloodhound SSC on the runway at Newquay, we were asking the car to do a whole lot of things it wasn\'t designed for.  Running on a short track (OK, 1.7 miles of runway may not sound short, but at 200mph it certainly short), the car had to speed up and slow down very quickly.  Put it another way: we were trying to operate a supersonic land speed record car like a 5-tonne jet-powered drag racer.  The thing that still surprises me is just how well the car did that, and how easy it made it look.  This car is like nothing I have driven before: its performance is simply astonishing.  The car is now back in pieces, with the EJ200 jet engine removed and "inerted" once more.  If the EJ200 is not used for 90 days or more, all of the pipework is flushed through and filled with an "inerting" fluid that prevents corrosion.  This is a standard procedure for a jet engine, to make sure it\'s in tip-top condition for next year\'s runs.  It might look a little sad to see it end such a successful year in pieces, but that is the life of a prototype racing car.  Even without the need to inert the EJ200, we would still have to strip the car down, to clean and protect all the metal components from corrosion.  At Newquay we were out in all weathers to get the testing completed, which meant that the car occasionally got damp.  Some of you may have noticed the condensation building up in the cockpit during our first public runs, following rain early that morning.  As a result, the first time we took the car to 200mph, I had a misted-up windscreen and helmet visor. Now we need to make sure that the whole car is thoroughly dried out, and cleaned and oiled (or greased, lubricated, coated, treated, etc.) where necessary, ready to re-assemble for more adventures in 2018. Talking of 2018, we\'re off to South Africa!  Next year is going to be , as we aim to get the car above 500mph for the first time.  It\'s taken far longer than we wanted, but finally the car is ready for some high-speed testing.  Personally, I think we might get a wee bit faster than 500, but you\'ll have to wait until next year to find out.  The aim is to get over halfway to our ultimate goal of 1,000mph, to develop and test the basic platform of our jet-powered chassis, steering, brake parachutes, desert wheels, so that it\'s ready to receive the rocket pack, which is still under development.  We\'re still watching desert conditions closely, thanks to Surrey Satellites and their superb pictures.  After a reassuringly dry year, the first signs of water have just started to appear at the top of Hakskeen Pan.  We can expect more flooding over the next few months, as the wet season repairs and improves the desert surface, ready for Bloodhound\'s first runs next year.  As well as testing the car at much higher speeds, Bloodhound 500 is another chance to show the car off to a global audience.  We will be testing the live video and data streaming, relayed through the huge 70-metre-tall MTN phone/data masts, then out to the world thanks to Oracle\'s global cloud services.  Next year we\'ll be finding out how this car handles at 500+ mph.  Want to come along for the ride?  Thanks to MTN, Oracle and co, the live streaming will let you do just that.   We\'re also going to take the opportunity to offer small groups of VIP visitors a personal trip to see the car run.  I\'ve talked to a lot of people about watching a land speed record car run, although I confess I haven\'t seen it myself (I\'ve been busy each time, inside the car).  Every one of the spectators tells me that it\'s an unforgettable sight, so next year is a chance for some lucky people to see Bloodhound run at high speed for the first time.  To that end, we\'re offering a limited number of "Access All Areas" passes.  Come and join the next step in our "Engineering Adventure" with a visit to Hakskeen Pan - you can find more details on the project\'s website at . Running the car next year will also give our key audience - the young engineers and scientists of tomorrow - their first chance to follow the car\'s high-speed development.We\'re thrilled by the fact that we are already reaching over 100,000 students a year in the UK alone, with a much larger number following Bloodhound around the world.  With higher speeds, and live video and data streaming, we are (as you would expect) aiming for even bigger audiences.  We\'re also going to be busy running our various events at the Bloodhound Technical Centre.  This includes our build-your-own rocket car workshop.  If you\'re looking for something to do over the Christmas holidays, there\'s still time to book your place for one of . Go along, go fast, and enjoy.  With a successful and exciting 2017 behind us, we\'ve now got an exciting and high-speed 2018 to look forward to.  From all in the Bloodhound team, here\'s hoping that you enjoy the New Year adventures we have in store.  Happy Christmas! ']	 CATEGORY:Science

He said: "There was a bit of an adjustment period when the initial legislation came in in England. But everyone is pretty comfortable with it now."Plastic bags at airport shops or on board trains, planes or ships are currently not included, and neither are paper bags.More broadly, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government would take a stand against the "profligate" use of natural resources with its 25-year plan.Last week, she said 50 million trees would be planted in a "Northern Forest" stretching along the M62 corridor between Liverpool and Hull over the coming 25 years, to boost natural habitats and give people access to more woodland.']	 CATEGORY:Science

CONTENT:  ['The administration of US President Donald Trump has exempted the state of Florida from controversial plans for offshore drilling for oil and gas.The reversal comes after vocal opposition from the state\'s Republican Governor Rick Scott when the plans were announced last week.It is set to trigger further demands for exemptions from other states.The five-year plan was to open 90% of the nation\'s offshore reserves to leasing from drilling companies.US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said it would boost the economy and ensure US "energy dominance", but environmentalists decried it as a "shameful giveaway" to the oil industry."The governor," he said simply., he explained that he agreed with Gov Scott\'s position that "Florida is unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver."As a result... I am removing Florida from consideration from any new oil and gas platforms."He said President Trump had directed him to "take into consideration the local and state voice" in deciding policy.Gov Scott cheered the decision, saying he would "never stop fighting for Florida\'s environment and our pristine coastline".But Florida\'s Democratic Senator Bill Nelson smelled a rat.I have spent my entire life fighting to keep oil rigs away from our coasts. This is a political stunt orchestrated by the Trump administration to help Rick Scott who has wanted to drill off Florida\'s coast his entire career. We shouldn’t be playing politics with the future of FL. End of Twitter post  by @SenBillNelsonGov Scott is reportedly planning to run for an open US Senate seat.It means some of the Gulf of Mexico on Florida\'s western coast will be exempt from drilling, but not all of it.Florida state waters extend three nautical miles from the shore on the Atlantic, and nine nautical miles on the Gulf side, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)."Such a quick reversal begs the question: Will the Trump administration give equal consideration to all the other coastal governors from both parties who overwhelmingly reject this radical offshore drilling plan?" asked Diane Hoskins, director of the Oceana campaign group, according to Reuters news agency.Maryland, South Carolina and Massachusetts are among states with Republican governors also known to oppose the Draft Five Year Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Programme (2019-2024).California\'s attorney general was among several public figures who demanded similar exemptions for their states: .: California is also "unique" & our "coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver." Our “local and state voice” is firmly opposed to any and all offshore drilling.  If that\'s your standard, we, too, should be removed from your list. Immediately. End of Twitter post  by @AGBecerraBoth the scale and the nature of the plan have attracted criticism - including from a coalition of 60 environmental groups, nearly a dozen attorneys general and more than 100 US lawmakers. It opens up more than 90% of the national outer continental shelf (OCS) for development - making more than 98% of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources in federal offshore areas available to private companies.At the moment, 94% of the OCS is protected.Industry regulation was tightened by Barack Obama in the aftermath of BP\'s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 - a disaster still fresh in many minds.Even the Department of Defense has concerns - about how drilling will interact with the military exercises held in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, reports Reuters. However, industry groups have welcomed the plan.']	 CATEGORY:Science

Astronauts grow an average of between 2-5cm in space.This is because of the absence of gravity which allows the vertebrae in their spines to spread apart. "Good morning, everybody. I have a major announcement today. We had our bodies measured after reaching space, and wow, wow, wow, I had actually grown by as much as 9cm! "I grew like some plant in just three weeks.

CONTENT:  ['A Nasa telescope housed on a converted jumbo jet has yielded important insights into how stars are born from collapsing gas and dust.Measurements by the Sofia observatory underline the importance of magnetic fields for star formation.Astronomers used an instrument on Sofia to study one of the closest stellar nurseries to Earth - Rho Ophiuchi A.They discussed details of the work at the "Understanding how stars and planets are formed is one of the greatest challenges of modern astronomy," said co-author Fabio Santos, from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois."We know that stars and planets are formed in giant clouds of molecular gas and dust that exist in the plane of the Milky Way galaxy."The basic idea is that these clouds contract under their own gravity. Becoming ever more dense, they fragment into gaseous clumps and, from there, dense structures called "cores" are formed.It is within these dense cores of dust and gas that infant stars are found.But the devil is in the detail: "It\'s a very complicated process," said Dr Santos.The astronomers trained Sofia\'s HAWC+ instrument on Rho Ophiuchi A, which is actively forming hundreds of young stars. Many of which will probably become stars like our Sun, complete with their own planetary systems.HAWC+ is sensitive to emission in the far-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Data from the instrument allowed researchers to show that dust grains in the cloud were aligned with magnetic fields.Furthermore, they found that changes in the way dust aligned along field lines were closely related to differences in the density of the star-forming cloud. The measurement represents the first of its kind - and Sofia is uniquely equipped to perform such observations.The result supports an existing theory called Radiative Alignment Torque (RAT).Dr Santos explained: "The interstellar grains need radiation to align efficiently. It is expected that the grains in the outskirts of the cloud receive more radiation so they should be better aligned (with magnetic fields). "As you go to the darker (and denser) parts of the cloud, the grains receive less radiation - so they are not very well aligned anymore."But how does all this help better explain how stars and planets form?"The cloud has mass, and therefore it has gravity. So you would think that it should just contract and create stars in there. But there are more things involved - one of these other things are magnetic fields," Dr Santos told me here at the astronomy meeting in National Harbor, just outside Washington DC."You can think of the magnetic field as this net of lines that is mixed together with the material in the cloud. Whenever the cloud contracts, it brings the field lines together. So, it acts as a kind of tension that holds the material together. "There is an idea that if you have very strong magnetic fields in some parts of the galaxy, you could run into a situation where gravity will not be able to overcome this magnetic tension. So you won\'t be able to form any stars... the magnetic field lines don\'t let the material collapse."At the other end of the spectrum, weaker magnetic fields should in theory be overcome by gravity, initiating star formation.Understanding patterns in the magnetic fields of star-forming regions might help us predict how they will evolve in future. The strength of the magnetic fields in space could also influence how massive stars grow to be, and, potentially, whether planetary systems can form around them, Dr Santos added.The US-German Sofia (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) observatory is based around a modified Boeing 747SP aircraft. While flying at altitudes of about 12km (41,000ft), a large door in the aft fuselage is opened, allowing a 2.5m diameter telescope to observe the sky.The aircraft can rise above most of the water vapour in the Earth\'s atmosphere - which can block some infrared wavelengths from reaching the ground.The project is managed for Nasa by the Universities Space Research Association (USRA), while the German parts of the venture are managed by a special organization - the DSI (Deutsches SOFIA Institut).Follow Paul ']	 CATEGORY:Science

CONTENT:  ['Antarctica may be thousands of kilometres from the central Pacific but events there can have a significant effect on the White Continent\'s ice. Scientists have shown how ice shelves - the floating fronts of marine-terminating glaciers - respond to the El Niño phenomenon. The warming of tropical eastern Pacific seawaters will lead to a change in wind patterns in the polar south. This promotes snowfall on the shelves, and also melting of their undersides. These are competing processes, of course. One adds mass; one takes it away. However, the net outcome is a loss, say scientists. The reason? The ice removed from underneath the floating slabs has a higher density than the fluffy new snow at the surface. It is another example of the complexity researchers need to grasp as they try to gauge how Antarctica will react to a warming world. Although much of the continent is relatively static in its behaviour at the moment, it is losing ice in the west, especially in the Amundsen Sea sector, where glaciers are thinning and accelerating. The ice being shed in this region -  - adds to global sea-level rise. Dr Fernando Paolo, from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and colleagues . They analysed more than two decades of satellite radar measurements of ice shelves. The spacecraft have continuously tracked the height of the shelves since 1994. Once the scientists had removed the long-term negative trend, they found a variable signal that could be tied to the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This oscillation famously sees surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific seesaw between warmer than average conditions (El Niño) and cooler than average phases (La Niña). ENSO is recognised to have global influence, altering patterns of rainfall and drought, for example. And in the southern polar region, it appears to influence atmospheric pressure fields. One in particular, referred to as the Amundsen Sea Low, governs both regional winds and ocean circulation. During an El Niño, this fosters higher snowfall rates on shelves, raising their height, but it also pulls more warm water up from the deep which can get under the shelves and melt them. The combined effect leads to a loss in mass of the shelves. In a big El Niño phase, like the one in 1997/98, this reduction can be equivalent in scale to that stemming from the ongoing, long-term negative thinning trend."That means for a short period of time you are adding the two together. And that\'s key information to put into computer models if you want to properly represent the dynamics of these systems," explained Dr Paolo, who has now moved to the US space agency.  In La Niña years, the reverse happens: less snowfall, but also less melting on the shelves\' undersides. This works briefly to slow the ongoing, long-term negative trend. "Before this we knew that ENSO should affect Antarctica - that it should affect the ocean and the atmosphere around the continent. But this is the first time we\'ve detected that signal on the ice shelves themselves," said Scripps co-author Prof Helen Fricker.The study shows the value of ongoing satellite measurements in polar regions. Because there can be several years between El Niño events, a single satellite may catch only a couple of occurrences during its operational life. An unbroken series of satellites is therefore required to capture the big picture. The European Space Agency (Esa) has managed to do this with its radar satellites ERS-1, ERS-2, Envisat and Cryosat - although that may not be the case for much longer as Cryosat is ageing and any replacement is unlikely to be available until the mid-2020s.Nasa has not done as well as Esa. It has a allowed a gap to develop between its satellite laser missions, which make very similar observations to radar over the Antarctic and the Arctic.  A major Earth observation report called the "" was delivered last week through the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and MedicineThe authors said it was "critical" that a satellite capability was maintained to measure ice elevation in the polar regions by either Europe or America.  and follow me on Twitter: ']	 CATEGORY:Science

CONTENT:  ['Repeat bouts of warmer seawater are posing a significant challenge to the world\'s tropical corals. A study of 100 reefs, , shows the interval between bleaching events in recent decades has shortened dramatically. It has gone from once every 25-30 years in the early 1980s to an average of just once every six years today. Bleaching is caused by anomalously warm water, which prompts coral polyps to eject their symbiotic algae. This drains the corals of their colour and is fatal unless conditions are reversed in a reasonably short time. But even if temperatures fall back quickly, it can still take many years for damaged reefs to fully recover. "If you go into the ring with a heavyweight boxer, you could probably stand up for one round, but once that second round comes - you\'re going down," said Dr Mark Eakin from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). "The acceleration in the return rate of bleaching events matches up very well with what the climate models have been telling us. They predict that by mid-century most of the world\'s coral reefs will be suffering yearly, or near-yearly, heat stress," he told BBC News. One telling observation in the assessment is that as global warming has progressed - the "cold" phases in the famous La Niña-El Niño ocean oscillation have today become warmer than the "hot" phases were three decades ago. "There basically are no cool years anymore; there are just years that aren\'t too hot," said Dr Eakin. Aside from their beauty, tropical corals provide important ecosystem services upon which the livelihoods of many millions of people depend. Reefs, for example, afford coastal protection from big waves, storms, and floods; they also act as key spawning and nursery grounds for economically important fish and other aquatic species. This study concentrates on the climate challenge to corals, but many reefs are also experiencing other stresses, including pollution, overfishing and habitat destruction. Unsurprisingly, the authors, led by Prof Terry Hughes from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, Australia, call for renewed efforts to constrain and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. But it is interesting to note how more radical conservation solutions are now increasingly being discussed. These touch on topics such as engineered super-corals that are better able to cope in very warm water, and how you might go about artificially cooling a reef at times of high stress.But co-author Prof Nick Graham from Lancaster University, UK, cautions that such technical fixes cannot really address the size of the problem."These types of restoration techniques can be achieved at very small scales, but they\'re extremely costly, and you\'re talking about hundreds of square metres - whereas the size of coral reefs are hundreds to thousands of square kilometres," he told BBC News."Coral reefs cover less than 0.1% of the world\'s oceans and yet they house a third of all marine biodiversity. And the oceans cover 70% of our planet so they\'re housing a huge amount of the biodiversity of our planet. So, anyone who cares about extinction, about biodiversity, needs to worry about the future of coral reefs."  and follow me on Twitter: ']	 CATEGORY:Science

CONTENT:  ['A final order for a batch of 10 Ariane 5 rockets has been raised.The vehicle, which has been the mainstay of European launcher activity for the past 20 years, will be phased out once its successor is in place.ArianeGroup, the French-led industrial consortium, expects its new Ariane 6 to be flying no later than mid-2020, and in full operational service in 2023.At that point, Ariane 5 can be retired. The last order ensures sufficient rockets are available for the handover. ArianeGroup CEO Alain Charmeau commented: "This production kick-off of 10 new Ariane 5 ECA represents, for the European industry, a total of more than 1 billion euros. "This also allows us to continue capitalising on the exceptional levels of quality and punctuality that have made Ariane 5 so successful, while being consistent with the rapid market introduction of Ariane 6."After a couple of early-career failures, the Ariane 5 has become a super-reliable vehicle.Its most recent outing in December was the 82nd straight successful flight.However, the vehicle is now considered too expensive for the way the launcher market is developing. And this need for change is emphasised by the rising prominence of the American SpaceX company which is able to recover and re-fly rockets, gaining further price advantage on top of the more modern production methods it uses.The Ariane 6, although not designed for reusability in the first instance, will nonetheless have a considerably cheaper ticket price than the Ariane 5.This should be possible through a reduced workforce, more efficient production and the incorporation of advanced manufacturing techniques. ArianeGroup and its subsidiary marketing company, Arianespace, hope this will keep the European offering competitive in the face of the American challenge.With this latest order, there are now 23 Ariane 5 launchers in production or to be produced. The current flight rate is about six missions a year. This gives an idea of how much longer the Ariane 5 will be available, given that its operation will soon dovetail with the Ariane 6.2017 saw an Ariane 5 lift its heaviest payload to date when it put two geostationary satellites into orbit in June. The total payload mass was 10,865 kg, of which 9,969 kg was the net weight of the two passenger spacecraft.SpaceX will soon debut its Falcon Heavy  rocket, which should more than double this capability. and follow me on Twitter: ']	 CATEGORY:Science 

CONTENT:  ['The US experienced a record year of losses from fires, hurricanes and other weather related disasters in 2017, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).Total losses amounted to $306bn the agency said, over $90bn more than the previous record set in 2005.Last year saw 16 separate events with losses exceeding $1bn, including Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.  Noaa confirmed that 2017 was the third warmest year on record for the US.Last year witnessed two Category 4 hurricanes make landfall in the States.Hurricane Harvey produced major flooding as a result of a storm surge and extreme rain. Nearly 800,000 people needed help. Researchers have  that climate change increased the likelihood of the observed rainfall by a factor of at least 3.5.Noaa says the total costs of the Harvey event were $125bn, which is second only to Hurricane Katrina in terms of costs over the 38 years the record has been maintained. Hurricane Irma was a Category 5 storm for the longest period on record. Rain gauges in Nederland, Texas, recorded 1,539mm, the largest ever recorded for a single event in the mainland US. Hurricanes Irma and Maria cost $50bn and $90bn respectively. As well as hurricanes, there were devastating fires in western states, particularly in California. While last winter and spring saw heavy rains in the region that alleviated a long-term drought, the resulting boom in vegetation created abundant wildfire fuel. Fires in both the north and south of California meant hundreds of thousands of residents had to be evacuated from their homes. The report from Noaa says that across the US, the overall cost of these fires was $18bn, tripling the previous wildfire cost record. Noaa confirmed that in overall temperature terms, it was the third warmest year in the US since records began in 1895, behind 2012 and 2016."In the general picture the warming [of the] US over the long term is related to the larger scale warming we have seen on the global scale," said Deke Arndt, chief of Noaa\'s monitoring section.  "The US will have a lot more year to year variability so that it bounces up and down depending on prevailing weather regimes. But the long term signal is tied with long term warming." The eastern US has been experiencing an extreme cold snap, leading some, such as US president Donald Trump, to query the impact of global warming. In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpHowever, Noaa scientists were quick to point out that cold spells do occur even if the overall temperature trend is rising. "We do live in a warming world but we still have very cold poles and we still have the same weather systems that pull cold air away from those poles and down to where we live," said Deke Arndt"We are still going to see blue blobs on the map, but when they average out with the pinks and red that we see over the course of the year, we end up seeing a pretty warm year."While Monday\'s temperature data from Noaa deals only with the US, last week the European Weather Centre said that globally, 2017 was in fact . According to those figures, 2017 was the warmest year on record without the influence of the El Niño weather phenomenon.  The calculation was derived from millions of observations from land, sea and space, combined with models. Temperatures in most regions of the world were above the 1981-2010 average - especially in the Arctic. On the island of Svalbard, the city of Longyearbyen repeatedly experienced mean monthly temperatures more than 6 degrees C above the long-term mark. In November last year the World Meteorological Organization  stating that 2017 was likely the second or third warmest year on record. That prediction will be clarified in the coming days and weeks as various agencies around the world publish their data for the full year. There are usually some small differences between the datasets held by the different national bodies based mainly on their coverage of the polar regions and and in their estimates of sea-surface temperature.

CONTENT:  ['In 2009, Polly Kitzinger was in a car crash that left her with devastating brain injuries. Her sister, Jenny, says Polly would have preferred not to have had the medical interventions that kept her alive, but her family was unable to persuade doctors to let her die. Jenny is now a passionate advocate of living wills, or "advance decisions".You always knew when Polly was in the room and you always knew what Polly thought. She was very persistent and passionate about what she believed. Some of us might have even called her stubborn. Hey, we come from a family like that. But even within my family, Polly stood out.Polly was a disability rights activist. She worked with people who\'d often lost the capacity to make their own decisions about medical treatment because of mental illness and she was a passionate advocate for people\'s own voices, values and choices being heard.And she absolutely reserved her right to make her own unwise decisions as well. You couldn\'t say to her: "Well, I\'m sure it\'s in your best interest to stay at university, or not to sail across the Atlantic in midwinter," or whatever it was. She took a lot of risks and it\'s a comfort that she lived life to the full and on her own terms until her car crash in 2009, when she was 48.• Prof Jenny Kitzinger is co-director of the , Cardiff University• The centre studies the care given to patients in vegetative or minimally conscious states, and how best to ensure that wishes of incapacitated patients are respected • She was speaking to PM on BBC Radio 4 - you can It was clear fairly early on with Polly that she would never leave 24/7 care and it was highly unlikely that she\'d ever be able to make her own choices about her life ever again.In the early months there was nothing, no signs of awareness at all. Then she did pass from a vegetative into a minimally conscious state and everyone agreed she was experiencing pain, which they did their best to manage, and that she was experiencing distress and confusion in her moments of alertness. There were clear moments where, for a moment you\'d think: "Oh, yes, she recognises me." Or maybe she\'d laugh and then another time she\'d cry or moan. There were many months of moaning. We, as her family, told the doctors that Polly, whom we\'d known for almost half a century, wouldn\'t want life-prolonging treatment - at that stage, during the first two years, this would have meant withdrawing the feeding tube. Either they didn\'t listen or they just kept telling us: "It\'s too early. We need to give her more time to emerge. We don\'t yet know whether she\'ll stay permanently vegetative or permanently minimally conscious." Or they maybe just didn\'t trust or believe us, because so many people would want to be given longer and many people would want to survive longer to see if they could regain full consciousness. Polly wasn\'t one of those.We tried to convince them. I went through all the letters I had from Polly, the backs of envelopes, the poetry she\'d written, her diary entries and we found some lovely stuff. A poem she\'d written about always wanting to carry her own backpack and make her own choices. A statement about her expectation that she was going to die young somewhere beautiful - and how that, for her, would be avoiding something that she might not want. It was almost prophetic. She had started off doing a bit of philosophy at university, and I had letters she\'d written to me about "I think, therefore, I am," and the importance of her mind to her identity. So we took all that in. I also wrote to everyone who was close to Polly and asked them to write a statement about what they thought Polly valued and I produced a 50-page dossier for the doctors and handed it in with a with a summary analysis at the start. And so we tried all that. The doctors didn\'t know what to do with it.They didn\'t seem to understand that even if there\'s no advance decision, you have to justify why you\'re giving someone treatment. If you can\'t justify it, and they haven\'t given consent, then it\'s assault. So you\'re meant to make sure you understand this patient and what they would\'ve wanted, insofar as that\'s possible. This is all spelt out in the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and in guidelines from the Royal College of Physicians and the British Medical Association. So you talk to family or friends and try and get a really holistic picture of that person\'s values and beliefs and feed that into your "Best Interests" decision.• An  (sometimes known as a living will) is a legally binding decision to refuse a specific type of treatment in the future if you lose capacity to make the decision for yourself at the time• People in Scotland can make an •  are non-legally binding statements that sets down your values, wishes preferences and beliefs regarding your future careSource: Polly was in the vegetative and then minimally conscious states for about two years. Since then she has been fully conscious, but her brain injuries have left her permanently dependent on 24/7 care for all her needs. She is unable to control her own environment, lacking the mental processing ability even to push a call button for help and the capacity to make her own choices about medical treatment.The law has been clarified since 2009 when Polly had her car crash, and the courts have made absolutely clear now with rulings like  that, if there isn\'t an advance decision, it doesn\'t mean the person has no wishes to be considered. This is something that Prof Celia Kitzinger, my sister and co-director at the Coma and Disorders of Consciousness Research Centre, and I have . We\'ve analysed and documented the clear direction of travel towards more person-centred "Best Interests" decision-making.The irony is I already knew about advance decisions - Polly had told me about them and was in favour of them. We were brought up by a mother, Sheila Kitzinger, who was passionate about control over one\'s own body and one\'s own life, particularly in relation to medicine, because of her campaigning around childbirth, so it was something as a family we were aware of. My mother already had an advance decision before Polly\'s accident - one that Polly had helped her write. But of course, Polly\'s mistake, like many of ours, was to think that only people who are older need advance decisions. Whereas actually, of course, as we discovered with Polly, it\'s the people who aren\'t expected to die soon who need advance decisions most - it\'s people who are in a car crash in their 20s or 30s or 40s, in my view. This is something you can do in an afternoon. , for example, has a lovely online form that just takes you through, step by step, the sort of criteria that for you are key to any decision to prolong your life or not - whether you feel you can tolerate a lot of pain, for instance, whether it\'s important that you can recognise your loved ones, whether you can make your own choices.There\'s this sense that it\'s all too difficult and: "Oh, well, I\'d rather tile my bathroom or go for walk."  So what I always say is: Don\'t just do this for yourself, do it for your family and also your clinical team who will be much happier knowing they\'re giving you the treatment that you want and not the treatment that you don\'t want. At the Centre, we\'ve spoken to almost 100 family members now who\'ve had relatives in a vegetative or minimally conscious state, and their message is: "I wish my son or daughter, husband, wife, or mother had written down their wishes." I recognise that there\'s a fear among some people that family members might just be bumped off because they\'re inconvenient. Polly\'s consultant did say to me that she never trusted a family until she\'d worked with them for a year or more. But what that meant was that there was no voice for Polly because families are not to be trusted until you get to know them.So that again comes back to why it\'s so important that  as a person who might lose capacity should record a value statement about what you want - and if you wanted to be legally binding, write an advance decision. My mother was utterly devastated by what happened to Polly. I think it was a huge shock - to not be able to protect your daughter from something that you so clearly knew she would not want. And as a feminist who had achieved worldwide change for women in childbirth, and someone who was hugely powerful, to be rendered a mother unable to protect your daughter - it was unbearable.Sheila\'s advance decision was very particular to Sheila. One of her very clearly expressed wishes was that she wanted to die at home. She did not want to be transferred to hospital and that\'s not necessarily a wish I agree with. I don\'t think for everybody in every situation that home is the best place to die. But it was certainly Sheila\'s view for herself and she was very passionate about that. Her death was a good death. When you\'ve seen prolonged end-of-life stages maintained by medical interventions that someone wouldn\'t want, you really know what a good death is. She was able, almost until the end, to make her own requests and choices. She had a view out of a window, of trees. Her pain and her symptoms were well-managed. She had just finished her autobiography, and as she died, we were reading the proofs to her, so that was very fitting.Polly is no longer on a feeding tube. We can spoon-feed her. My sister Tess is dedicating her life to trying to maximise Polly\'s quality of life. And there\'s a great team in the care home. We have a "do not attempt resuscitation" notice informed by her values and beliefs and she wouldn\'t be treated for life-threatening infections. There isn\'t any hope that she will regain her ability to make her own choices. It\'s nine years on, it doesn\'t happen that way. It\'s not like in the movies. But of course we live with hope for a good death for her eventually, belatedly - we can hope for that.']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['Ten million people in the UK - one in six of us - have some degree of hearing loss. The main causes are hereditary factors, noise exposure, trauma and ear diseases. And, of course, there is age. Like getting fatter and going grey, we tend to think of hearing loss as an inevitable part of ageing, and it is certainly true that as you get older your hearing tends to get worse. More than 40% of people over 50 have some degree of hearing loss, rising to 70% of those over the age of 70.The good news is that there are things you can do to about it. The bad news is that there are potentially serious consequences if you choose to ignore hearing loss, including an increased risk of dementia.I have a very personal interest in this as my hearing isn\'t as good as it used to be. When I go into pubs or restaurants with lots of reflective surfaces I struggle to hear what is being said. Unlike my children, who are happily shouting at each other, I sit there, perhaps catching one word in three and pretending to follow the conversation. This is tiring because I am having to concentrate hard, and it is also embarrassing because I know I\'m missing details and yet I don\'t want to keep asking them to repeat themselves. "What???" "What????"For many people, gradual hearing loss is far more than an inconvenience: it can lead to social isolation, which in turn can contribute to mental health problems such as depression. And there is also mounting evidence that hearing loss can significantly increase your risk of developing dementia. So it\'s really important that you don\'t ignore it. Yet on average, people in the UK wait for a staggering 10 years before they seek treatment. According to the charity, , only around 40% of people who need hearing aids have them.This may be because their GP hasn\'t referred them to an NHS audiology service, or because they are worried about being given a large and very obtrusive hearing aid. Although hearing aids are far more discreet and effective than they used to be, many people are still reluctant to wear them.Another reason why many people don\'t get treatment is because they simply don\'t notice that their hearing is declining. It\'s surprisingly tricky to spot gradual hearing loss as our brains are very good at compensating, so we\'re not even aware of how much we\'ve lost until things are quite far advanced. Warning signs you may be losing it include:•         Having the TV on very loud•         Struggling to follow conversations•         Missing phone calls or the front door bell•         Denying you have a problem!Auditory neuroscientist Dr Jennifer Bizley says that one of the ways people get round the problem of hearing loss is by relying on one of their other senses, vision, far more. "We used to think that dedicated bits of the brain did hearing, and a separate bit did vision, and only later was that information put together. "Now we know that actually there\'s cross-talk between the senses at a really early stage, and one of the things that we think that information could be doing is helping you in situations that are difficult, like listening in a noisy restaurant. "Being able to see a mouth movement or see gestures might allow you to pull that person\'s voice out of a sound mixture - out of the noise - more effectively."So if you don\'t want to go for a hearing aid, but struggle in social situations, then you might want to try some of the following tips: •         If you\'re with other people, place yourself in the middle of the group•         Have the light behind you, to help you see the other person\'s face clearly•         Ask people to face you when they are talking to you and not cover their mouths•         And - if you\'re really keen - you could try learning to lip-read Molly Berry, chairwoman of the , thinks learning to lip-read is a valuable skill and that it is about more than simply helping you follow the conversation"It\'s not just that you are learning a skill that\'s going to help you, it is giving you brain training: training your brain to look and listen at the same time, and get the gist of everything that\'s happening, which helps you not to get the cognitive decline that can be associated with hearing loss."The effects of hearing loss on cognitive skills and memory can be quite profound. But the encouraging thing is that if you correct the hearing loss you can prevent the cognitive decline. A  by Johns Hopkins researchers in the US, which compared intervention with non-intervention, showed this quite clearly. So although there\'s no cure for age-related hearing loss, there\'s plenty you can do to help improve things. The important message here is if you think your hearing\'s deteriorating, don\'t delay: get help from your GP who should be able to rule out any temporary causes and refer you for a hearing test, if you need it.']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['Sales of coconut oil are rocketing, propelled by celebrity endorsements and claims that drinking the stuff will cure everything from bad breath to digestive disorders.  Actress Angelina Jolie-Pitt is said to have a tablespoon or so with her breakfast most mornings, while model Miranda Kerr says she not only adds it to salads and smoothies, but she cooks with it and splashes it on her skin as well.The health claims that swirl around coconut oil are treated with a great deal of scepticism by scientists. If anything coconut oil is seen, in the scientific community, as an unhealthy fat. It is very high in saturated fat (86%), even more so than butter (51%) or lard (39%).The reason that foods rich in saturated fats are frowned on is because eating them causes a rise in blood levels of LDL (low density lipoprotein). LDL is known as "bad cholesterol" because high levels are linked with increased risk of heart disease.  On the other hand, saturated fats - which are particularly bad for you - also tend to raise HDL, "good" cholesterol, which has the opposite effect. It is possible that a particular food can raise overall cholesterol levels, yet still be heart-friendly.So is coconut oil a cholesterol-busting wonder food, as some claim, or is this all dangerous hype?Despite all the sound and fury that surrounds coconut oil there have been surprisingly few human studies carried out to test specific health claims. So for the current BBC2 series of Trust Me I\'m a Doctor, we thought we should help organise a trial. The Trust Me team started by contacting Prof Kay-Tee Khaw and Prof Nita Forouhi, both eminent Cambridge academics. With their help we recruited 94 volunteers, aged 50-75 and with no history of diabetes or heart disease, and designed a study to assess what effect eating different types of fat would have on their cholesterol levels.We began by randomly allocating our volunteers to one of three groups. Every day for four weeks,  the first was asked to eat 50g of extra virgin coconut oil - that\'s about three tablespoons full.The second group was asked to consume the same amount of extra virgin olive oil. Olive oil is a key element of the Mediterranean diet, which is widely seen as being extremely healthy.  And the third was asked to eat 50g of unsalted butter a day. Again, that adds up to just over three tablespoons.The volunteers were told that they could consume these fats in whatever way they pleased, as long as they did so every day for the whole four weeks. They were also warned that, because they were consuming an extra 450 calories a day, they might well put on some weight.Before our volunteers started on their new high-fat regime we took blood samples to get baseline measurements, focusing mainly on their levels of LDL (the "bad" cholesterol) and HDL (the "good" cholesterol)The importance of these two measures is that your heart attack risk is best calculated, not by looking at your total cholesterol score, but your total cholesterol divided by your HDL score. NHS Choices suggests that this figure should be below four.So what happened? As expected the butter eaters saw an average rise in their LDL levels of about 10%, which was almost matched by a 5% rise in their HDL levels Those consuming olive oil saw a small reduction, albeit a non-significant drop, in LDL cholesterol, and a 5% rise in HDL. So olive oil lived up to its heart-friendly reputation.But the big surprise was the coconut oil. Not only was there no rise in LDL levels, which was what we were expecting, but there was a particularly large rise in HDL, the "good" cholesterol, up by 15%On the face of it that would suggest that the people consuming the coconut oil had actually reduced their risk of developing heart disease or stroke.I asked Prof Khaw, who was clearly surprised by these results, why she thought it had happened"I have no real idea," she candidly replied. "Perhaps it is because the main saturated fat in coconut oil is lauric acid and lauric acid may have different biological impacts on blood lipids to other fatty acids. The evidence for that comes mainly from animals, so it was fascinating to see this effect in free-living humans."So should we be hailing coconut oil as a health food?"I think decisions to eat particular oils depend on more than just the health effects", she said. "This is just one study and it would be irresponsible to suggest changing dietary advice based on one study, however well conducted."This was a very short-term study and compared to olive oil, research on coconut oil is at an early stage. So the claims about coconut oil being a superfood are premature. But if, like me, you enjoy putting coconut in your curries, there seems no very good reason to stop. ']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['January is a peak time for downloading health and fitness apps and putting those Christmas present fitness trackers to work. But do they actually help you stay motivated?After the Christmas self-indulgence comes the inevitable New Year\'s resolution to get fit, lose weight, and eat more healthily. But while 65% of us make resolutions, only 12% successfully keep to them, polling firm ComRes finds. Can tech help?When Sarah, 34, a law professor from Australia, wanted to lose weight last year, she took the unusual approach of placing bets that she would achieve her exercise goals. Breast cancer had stopped her exercise routine, and she\'d gained weight during a year which included three operations, she says."I was returning to exercise by hiking and trying to lose some of the weight I\'d put on while being sedentary," she says.She began a new exercise routine eight weeks after finishing breast reconstruction surgery. With a wearable activity tracker, she monitored the steps she took each day and the calories she burned.But she also motivated herself with an app, Step Bet, that let her wager whether she would achieve her exercise goals."I did three one-month bets and three six-month bets, and lost 7kg [15 lbs] - 10% of my body weight," says Sarah.She also says she made £358 [$458; €403].  "I like losing fat. I don\'t like losing money. The effect? Motivation!" she explains.For the data-minded, tracking your progress with reams of measurements is enough to stay motivated.Arshia Gratiot, who is 40 and originally from Bangalore, has been using a fitness tracker for a year, "to measure biometrics such as my heart rate, associated with my level of fitness," she says.In 2016, she founded a technology start-up with offices in Finland, India, and London. Frequently travelling across time zones made her decide to go running each evening - sometimes in the middle of the night - while listening to podcasts.  "It was either lie in bed like a zombie, totally jet-lagged, or hit the road.  It was the only way I could stay sane," she says.Tracking her heart rate and metabolism offered "a visual way to track progress over time" and encouraged her, says Ms Gratiot.But it\'s how we use such data that matters, argues Anil Aswani, an assistant professor in industrial engineering and operations research at the University of California, Berkeley."Personalized goal setting is a very important aspect of these apps," he says The better exercise apps learn from how you\'ve done in the past to tailor your goals, he argues. And doing this builds a sense of achievement, which behavioural psychologists say is important in altering your habits."If you\'re effective at meeting goals today, it boosts your confidence and makes you more likely to meet your goals in the future," says Prof Aswani.In his own research, one group of test subjects was given a changing number of steps as a goal each day, based on their previous progress. Another was assigned the same number of steps every day.The group given adaptive goals averaged about 1,000m more each day, he says.Joseph Laws, a former US army Ranger who served in Afghanistan and afterwards worked as a software engineer at Google, has developed his own way of setting adaptive goals. Based on his army experience, he began developing fitness routines for friends and family. Later, he started developing machine learning algorithms to find out which exercises best built fitness, based on age, sex, height, and weight.Mr Laws released the official version of his app, Optimize, six months ago.The challenge was "developing a model of fitness, and mapping those equations to actual exercises," he says. Once he had the model in place, his algorithms could learn and improve each time a person exercised. The workouts would then adapt to the person\'s past performance.Around 90% of users who make it to their fourth workout continue to use it for the next two months, he says. Most of the data comes from people "20 to 50 years old", he says, so the next challenge is gathering more data from older exercisers, and other non-typical groups, such as people with injuries.Other fitness start-ups are trying to apply machine learning to calorie counting.Charles Teague\'s app, Lose It!, began by asking users to log everything they ate, then keeping track of their calories and nutrients, he says.This, as everyone knows who\'s tried it, is a bit of a faff."So wouldn\'t it be great if you could just take a picture of your food, and it was just logged?" he asks.A year ago, he introduced a feature called Snap It, which is learning how to identify food on a plate. "The data we\'ve accumulated today would do things like recognise that\'s pasta, that\'s an apple, that\'s a banana," says Mr Teague.But more data is needed if the app is to discern spaghetti bolognese from fettuccine alfredo, for example.At the moment, users train the algorithm as they use it, by selecting the precise type of food in front of them from options the algorithm identifies. So it will take time before the app becomes sufficiently clever to recognise most food variants.With the World Health Organisation saying obesity is now more common than under-nutrition, researchers agree apps based on health and psychological research have the potential to transform how we eat and exercise.But of 29,000 apps relating to weight loss and fitness, only 17 were based on verifiable scientific research, a 2016 study at the Catholic University of Louvain found.Despite this, the global mobile fitness app market grew from $1.8bn in 2016 to $2.2bn, says research firm Statista, while the fitness wearables market was worth $6.1bn in 2017, a figure expected to reach $7.5bn by 2022.So as well as thinking about what you eat and how far you run, it\'s worth checking out the credentials of the fitness app or tracker first before committing your hard-earned cash.What works for you will depend largely on your personality and what pushes your motivational buttons.']	 CATEGORY:Health

The company\'s technical director, Prof Roland Leigh, says it is the most detailed model yet for assessing air quality in Britain."By focussing it down we can really isolate the hotspots of poor air quality, and better target our solutions."Prof Leigh says it\'s important to be aware of bad pollution levels where you live, or near schools or your route to work, but that no areas in Britain are bad enough that people should avoid exercising outside."Air quality is actually getting better in Britain, and we are in a better state than a large number of countries - ."In Britain, it\'s always better to be outside exercising than inside avoiding pollution, even in the worst areas."In the study, each area is rated on a scale from 1, least polluted, to 6, most polluted.

CONTENT:  ['Winter is here, the NHS is under mounting pressure and national A&E targets are being missed. So how does Luton & Dunstable University Hospital consistently buck the trend?  Current figures show 98.6% of patients are treated, assessed or discharged within four hours in A&E, comfortably ahead of the 95% target. Some in the health service question whether an obsessive focus on the 95% mark can distort performance and undermine patient care.  Others acknowledge that it\'s a valuable benchmark for monitoring the timely treatment of patients.  Luton & Dunstable took on the challenge of getting to the target and staying there from 2012 - but it didn\'t happen overnight.Leadership was a key element in Luton & Dunstable\'s progress on A&E performance.  Pauline Philip arrived as chief executive in 2010 and let all staff know that the 95% target was a priority for the whole hospital. As one doctor noted "she wouldn\'t ask anyone to do something she wouldn\'t do". So if there was a problem late on a Sunday evening in A&E, she would come into the hospital to help remove any barriers in the system which might be impeding the treatment of patients.\n                                    \n                                    \n                                \n                                        \n                                        \n                                    Dame Pauline, who was honoured this year, realised the importance of partnerships outside the hospital. She was ready to pick up the phone to the chief executives of local authorities to call for help in removing barriers in social care which might be preventing patients leaving hospital. It was no surprise when Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, asked her to head up national urgent and emergency care.  On secondment from Luton & Dunstable, she is at the centre of NHS England\'s effort to monitor the service\'s response to winter pressures. Marion Collict, Director of Operations, Risk & Governance, has no doubts about the importance of drive from the top level of the trust: "Strong purposeful leadership and investment in people and the working environment has been key to the delivery of the emergency department target and it should be noted that the same purposeful leadership was also applied to the achievement of the cancer and 18-week targets."Managing the flow of patients is carefully planned. Patients who could be appropriately treated by GPs are referred straight to an urgent care centre near the front door of the hospital.  The danger of overcrowding in the emergency department was recognised and the area was expanded to include the GP centre. Senior doctors are on hand to decide whether some patients arriving can safely be sent away or encouraged to seek advice elsewhere, for example from a local pharmacist.Management are insistent that this is a challenge which goes right across the hospital rather than being seen as an A&E problem.  If there are not enough beds available for new patients, delays build up in A&E.  Consultants and other experienced doctors are deployed to closely monitor patients who have been admitted to hospital from A&E with a view to moving them on when safe to do so, which is when freeing up beds as quickly as possible becomes the primary objective.David Kirby, a senior consultant in emergency medicine at the hospital, sums up the approach: "We have a team of people dedicated to this process and serve only this emergency department to get through the hospital and the system and back out, so we can so we can see new arrivals and new emergencies"Delays transferring elderly patients back into the community because of social care problems cause immense strain across the hospital system.  Luton & Dunstable has worked relentlessly with local authorities to minimise delayed discharges. A senior member of the hospital staff with extensive social care experience assesses all elderly patients from the moment they are admitted to hospital. She has access to money from the Better Care Fund (the vehicle designed to join up NHS and local council care) and can authorise spending to make it easier for older patients to recover safely from their conditions at home.Staff from local health commissioning groups and local councils visit the hospital on certain days to go through the notes on every patient seen in the emergency department that day and then sent home following assessment. The aim is to find out whether better care in the local community would have prevented them ending up in A&E. Nobody at Luton & Dunstable is taking anything for granted.  They know that unexpected events and pressures can throw any hospital off course, especially in winter.  But with many other hospital managers beating a path to their door to find out how targets are hit, they are happy to pass on what they have learned over the last few years. ']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['Singing could help mothers recover from post-natal depression more quickly, a study suggests. Researchers found that women who took part in group singing sessions with their babies experienced a much faster improvement in their symptoms than those who did not.The study, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, looked at 134 mothers with post-natal depression. Early recovery is seen to be crucial to limit effects on mother and baby.Post-natal depression is estimated to affect one in eight new mothers. Previous studies have indicated singing can help improve the mental health of older people and those with dementia, but this is the first controlled study of its effect on post-natal depression. The women were placed into three groups:The singing workshops saw the mothers learning lullabies and songs from around the world with their babies and creating new songs together about motherhood. And those with moderate to severe symptoms of post-natal depression reported a much faster improvement than mothers in the usual care and play groups.All the groups improved over the 10 weeks, but in the first six weeks the singing group had already reported an average 35% decrease in depressive symptoms. Principal investigator Dr Rosie Perkins said the study, although small, was significant because it was important to tackle the symptoms as quickly as possible. "Post-natal depression is debilitating for mothers and their families, yet our research indicates that for some women something as accessible as singing with their baby could help to speed up recovery at one of the most vulnerable times of their lives," she said.  Lead author Dr Daisy Fancourt, from University College London, said singing was another useful therapy to offer women."Many mothers have concerns about taking depression medication whilst breast-feeding and uptake of psychological therapies with new mothers is relatively low," she said."So these results are really exciting as they suggest that something as simple as referring mothers to community activities could support their recovery."  Dr Trudi Seneviratne, who chairs the Royal College of Psychiatrists\' Perinatal Faculty, said: "It\'s exciting to hear about the growing evidence base for novel psychosocial interventions such as singing to facilitate a more rapid recovery for women with post-natal depression. "I look forward to more work in this area in the future, as it will be enjoyed by both mothers and their babies."Since the study, Breathe Arts Health Research has started running singing workshops in partnership with Guy\'s and St Thomas\' NHS Foundation Trust for women with post-natal depression across the south London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark.

CONTENT:  ['What will you be like in your 80s? Living independently, robust in body and mind, with a wide social circle?    Manage that and you will be a superager. It is a worthy aspiration, but the reality is rather different for most of us.Although we are living longer,  often with multiple chronic conditions.Of the 65 million people in the UK, 8.45 million are projected to live to 100, according to analysis from the Office for National Statistics.That\'s around one in eight of the population and a timely reminder that many of us will spend a third of our lives in old age.Ageing is a global issue - the number of people aged 65 and older is projected to California is one of the key centres for ageing research - and it\'s where I met both scientists and superagers.Let\'s start with Irene Obera. She\'s 84 and the fastest woman on earth for her age.  Irene has been breaking world records in Masters athletics for four decades. She has the poise and physique of someone in their prime and makes age look like an irrelevance.Her philosophy is simple: "A quitter never wins, and a winner never quits - and I want to be a winner."  Being a winner involves grit, determination and relentless effort.I met Irene and her coach Alan Kolling at Chabot College, near San Francisco, where they train three or four times a week.   Then there are the gym sessions, tennis and bowling - Irene is on the go all day.  "You gotta use it, or you lose it," she says with a smile.  Her only period of ill-health was self inflicted - when she dropped a weight on her toe in the gym.As with all the superagers I\'ve met, Irene retains a positive attitude - her horizons have not narrowed as she has aged.She is socially connected; as well as all the people she meets through sport, Irene volunteers in her local community.Ageing well is about exercising the mind as well as the body.It\'s thought that  if more people looked after their brain health throughout life.I joined a French literature class at the Alliance Française in Berkeley, across the bay from San Francisco.  All the students were in their 70s, and retained the same curiosity and positive attitude which seem to be hallmarks of superagers.Pamela Blair, 76, a retired psychologist, told me: "I love the French language and its literature. But I\'m also here to exercise my mind - my mother had Alzheimer\'s".The idea that ageing itself can be targeted is gaining momentum, in part as a result of the work of scientists at the Clad in white Italian marble, with the same architect as the Louvre pyramid, the institute sits in the hills above Silicon Valley.It has nearly 300 scientists, spread across 18 laboratories, who investigate the connection between ageing and chronic disease.What is it that cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia and osteoarthritis all have in common?  The fact that your chances of getting any of them increase as you age.Prof Judy Campisi, one of the lead scientists at the Buck, told me: "It\'s not a coincidence that all these diseases occur at the same time - we think there are basic ageing processes that cause all of them."Like others at the Buck Institute, Prof Campisi is convinced that science will be able to help us age more healthily.  She said: "We predict there will be drugs that will treat ageing, and as a consequence we will be able to extend healthspan, the years of healthy life."This would mean people could look forward to the last decade of life being vibrant and engaged - their brains and bodies working optimally."As part of this series of reports on superagers I\'ll be looking at two drugs which some scientists believe could target the ageing process.

CONTENT:  ['NHS hospitals are facing major challenges in dealing with patient numbers, outbreaks of diseases like flu and hitting performance targets. So how do two of them, one in London, one in north-east England, cope with the strains they face?Most hospitals now find that patient numbers are equally high coming through the doors of A&E in summer and winter. There is no let-up throughout the year. That\'s certainly the case at Northwick Park in north-west London, which has one of the largest emergency departments in the UK, in terms of floorspace."We had a busy August with sustained demand for urgent care," says James Walters, deputy chief operating officer at the London North West Healthcare Trust, which runs Northwick Park. But, he adds, things are "concerning going into winter".Northwick Park has been planning for winter for some time, including providing extra beds. One priority is to encourage more walk-in care, with patients offered "comfy chairs" rather than beds in cubicles while they wait to be assessed or treated.But the big fear is a flu outbreak. The system was running at full tilt last winter across the NHS with hospitals running out of beds at times, and that was without a serious flu problem. Mr Walters says he is "very worried" that winter will bring a surge in flu cases.  As always the major challenge is finding beds for new arrivals: "We are always stuck with patients who would be better off outside the hospital," he says. One local authority employs health staff to go into the trust\'s hospitals to identify elderly patients who would be fit to leave if there was the right care in place in the local community. These staff then follow up with home visits.But, Mr Walters says, even with schemes to reduce delays discharging patients, there are problems in managing the flow of people through the hospital. "There\'s a real ethical dilemma," he explains "balancing between care of people coming in and freeing up beds".London North West Healthcare is the second busiest trust in London and has been struggling, like most others, to hit the 95% target for dealing with patients within four hours of arriving at A&E. Recent months have seen performance between 80 and 85%. The target of an 18-week wait for non-emergency surgery has also been missed. Mr Walters argues that while performance is important, prioritising the highest-risk patients and focusing on safety are the main aims. For routine surgery, "we appreciate we can\'t always provide timely care as we would wish."Dr Ali Refson is an experienced emergency medicine consultant who has been at Northwick Park for 17 years. For her, the increasing demand for care every year reflects the ageing population with multiple health problems. More people arrive with complicated conditions and through no fault of their own need longer to recover and more days occupying beds.She sees the system as a "bottomless pit" of requirements for care and the team on the frontline can only do their best to provide safe and compassionate treatment.Talk of targets, she believes, misses the point: "Every single number we have coming in is a human being, a patient, someone with relatives and they will have to be treated as best we can: reaching numbers to us is less important than actually looking after each person."Very few hospitals are hitting their targets most months but there is a cluster of them in the north-east of England. At the North Tees and Hartlepool Trust they believe that closely integrating the work of the main hospital and minor injuries units helps control the flow of patients through A&E.  Nick Roper, clinical director for emergency care, says they work closely with other hospitals in the region to develop new methods and processes: "There are a lot of good organisations locally that work very proactively to develop new ways of working. "We all work quite differently in many ways - in emergency care we\'re not afraid to try what other people have tried, to learn off each other, visit each other\'s organisations and see what they are doing and whether we can pinch any of their good ideas."One idea developed this year has already paid dividends. An experienced nurse at the reception area of University Hospital of North Tees makes a quick decision on where people arriving should go. Some are sent straight to the neighbouring urgent care centre.  Karen Blakemore, emergency department matron, says it has helped reduce the flow into A&E: "It\'s made a tremendous difference certainly for patients. We don\'t want patients sat in a waiting area in accident and emergency, particularly during very demanding times when they can be seen more effectively in the urgent care centre next door."North Tees and Hartlepool are quietly satisfied with their performance this year. But they are not pretending it is easy to fill vacancies at a time when there\'s a shortage of qualified staff. They are certainly not taking anything for granted as winter looms ahead.

CONTENT:  ['The NHS is preparing itself for a bad flu season.One of the strains circulating this year - H3N2 - has been dubbed Aussie flu because it is the same strain that recently caused big problems for Australia. Australia\'s 2017 flu season was the worst the country had experienced in nearly a decade. Experts are waiting to see if similar will happen in the UK, after a recent rise in cases.Every winter there are a few strains circulating and Aussie flu or H3N2 is just one of them. It is an influenza A virus that appears to cause more severe infections in young children and the elderly. Most people will recover in about a week and won\'t need any specific treatment, apart from a bit of bed rest, some paracetamol or ibuprofen and drinking plenty of fluids. But for some - the very old, very young or people with pre-existing health conditions such as heart disease - flu can be deadly.The UK is seeing a mix of flu types circulating including influenza B as well as the H3N2 strain. H3N2 is not new. It was around last winter too. Any strain of flu, including H3N2, can be dangerous for people who are vulnerable to it. Experience from last winter suggests the elderly are a high risk group for H3N2.Influenza viruses are given different names based on their type - A, B and C. A is usually the most serious while C is usually a milder infection. They can be further subdivided according to the proteins that they carry on their surface. These are called H and N antigens. Hospital admissions and GP visits for influenza have seen a sharp rise going into 2018, but are still comparable to the previous winter and are nowhere near as high as in 2008-09 when the swine flu pandemic hit the UK. Professor Paul Cosford, Medical Director, Public Health England said: "As we would expect at this time of year, flu levels have increased this week. Our data shows that more people are visiting GPs with flu symptoms and we are seeing more people admitted to hospitals with the flu. The vaccine is the best defence we have against the spread of flu and it isn\'t too late to get vaccinated."The vaccine is designed to protect against the type of flu circulating in any given season. Every year, the World Health Organization reviews the global situation and recommends which flu strains should go into the vaccine to be manufactured for the following season. This year\'s flu jab is designed to protect against H3N2 as well as some other strains.Vaccination is the best protection we have against flu.But flu is unpredictable. Flu viruses constantly mutate and change, so it is a moving target to fight. Public Health England says typical effectiveness of the flu vaccine is 40-60%, which means that for every 100 people vaccinated, between 40 and 60 will be protected.At risk people are advised to have annual flu jabs because flu strains can change from year to year, plus protection from the flu vaccine may wane after about six months.Adults aged over 65, pregnant women and those with underlying health conditions are advised to get a free flu jab.A flu nasal spray is available free to young children, who are thought to be the main spreaders of flu.In general, current flu vaccines tend to work better against influenza B and influenza A/H1N1 viruses than H3N2, according to US experts at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.And it\'s already known that flu vaccines may work less well in elderly people because they have weaker immune systems.Dr Richard Pebody, from Public Health England, said: "This season\'s flu vaccine should be providing reasonable protection, similar to last winter. Last year the vaccine did not give quite as good protection for the elderly for H3N2. "That\'s something that we are watching closely to see if it is an issue this winter."How the vaccines are made might also determine their effectiveness, according to research.Flu vaccines used in the UK and in many other parts of the world are currently grown in chicken eggs and this process can be tricky.Recent research in the journal  found the H3N2 part of the flu vaccine did not grow simply during this process and developed mutations. When they tested the vaccine in animals and humans they found the H3N2 part did a partial job of protecting against this strain of flu.The vaccine had 20-30% effectiveness against H3N2. Experts stress this is still our best defence against the virus.And the jab provides excellent protection against other flu strains.A spokesman from Public Health England said: "Although we would like this to be higher, this is still a very valuable level of protection against what can be a nasty and sometimes deadly illness."Experts recommend that all those who are eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS should take up the offer.If you want to protect yourself against flu and you\'re not in one of the groups, you can buy the flu jab from high street pharmacies.People who can get it for free from the NHS include:A flu nasal spray is available to two and three-year-olds and some children at primary school.Front-line health and social care workers are also eligible to receive the flu vaccine.Flu symptoms come on very quickly and can include:If you develop sudden chest pain, have difficulty breathing or start coughing up blood, call 999 or go to A&E. See your GP if:Flu is very infectious and easily spread to other people. You\'re more likely to give it to others in the first five days.Flu is spread by germs from coughs and sneezes, which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours.To reduce the risk of spreading flu:']	 CATEGORY:Health

CONTENT:  ['The new year is a time when many plan to shape up after the excesses of the festive period. Now there is good news for those who fear it might be too late in life to improve their fitness.People into late middle age can reverse or reduce the risk of heart failure caused by decades of sedentary living by exercising, a study has found.But there is a catch - it takes two years of aerobic exercise, four to five days a week, researchers said., analysed the hearts of 53 adults aged 45-64 who were healthy but had no history of exercising regularly. Research has shown that sedentary behaviours - such as sitting or reclining for long periods of time - increase the risk of heart disease. The study\'s participants were divided into two groups, with one following an aerobic exercise routine that progressed in intensity over the two years and another doing yoga, balance training and weight training three times a week, also for two years.  The aerobic exercise group showed an 18% improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a more than 25% improvement in "plasticity" in the left ventricular muscle of the heart - both markers of a healthier heart.However, the benefits were not seen in the second group.Dr Benjamin Levine, lead author of the study and the founder and director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, a joint programme between Texas Health Resources and UT Southwestern Medical Center Dallas, Texas, said: "The key to a healthier heart in middle age is the right dose of exercise, at the right time in life."We found what we believe to be the optimal dose of the right kind of exercise, which is four to five times a week, and the \'sweet spot\' in time, when the heart risk from a lifetime of sedentary behaviour can be improved - which is late-middle age. "The result was a reversal of decades of a sedentary lifestyle on the heart for most of the study participants."Participants exercised generally in 30-minute sessions, plus a warm-up and cool-down.Their routine included: They built up to those levels, beginning with three 30-minute moderate exercise sessions for the first three months after which high intensity exercise was included. Dr Levine told the BBC the take-home message from the research is that exercise needs to be a part of people\'s personal hygiene, like teeth brushing."It\'s not something that gets added on to the end of the day: You brush your teeth, you change your clothes, you eat food and drink water. "You do these things for personal hygiene. Exercise is equally important. You need to find ways to incorporate it into your daily activities." Dr Richard Siow, vice-dean for the faculty of life sciences and medicine at King\'s College London and director of ageing research at King\'s, told the BBC the study was valuable in that shows we can delay cardiovascular ageing.He said it provided further evidence that "we can, in a way, rejuvenate or make the cells in the heart, and also in the blood vessels for that matter, resemble younger cells through an exercise programme". "I think that\'s a very important take-home message for those of us who may have a doom and gloom view there\'s nothing we can do about it. Yes there is, we can start by getting off the couch to have a more active lifestyle."Dr Siow said the study also had ramifications for conditions relating to cognitive decline, such as dementia, because improved heart function facilitates blood flow to the brain."The wider ramifications of this study for healthy ageing need to be explored," he said.Previous studies have shown improvements in heart elasticity in young people after a year of training, but little change if the training was started after the age of 65, the report\'s authors said.They said the aerobic exercise regimen should be started before the age of 65 when the heart appears to retain "plasticity" and the ability to remodel itself.Dr Levine told the BBC his team would next look at whether the same kind of improvements shown in the study can be made in people at high risk of heart failure, such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those who are obese. However, researchers said there were a couple of limitations to the study. One was that volunteers were willing and able to participate in an intensive exercise regimen, which may not be the case for the general adult population. Another potential limitation was that most of the study\'s participants were white and it was not clear whether the results would apply to other racial groups, researchers said.It also does not mention diet or other factors that can affect health, such as pollution. "It needs to be taken into the context of a healthy lifestyle as well," Dr Siow added.  Follow Alex on ']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['These days, darts is a professional, sober affair, at least for the players. But some of the champions of the past were famous for their boozing. Can alcohol ever enhance people\'s ability to play darts?The answer depends on how nervous you are, and whether or not you\'re addicted to alcohol.Many studies have shown that even low levels of alcohol can impair motor skills and spatial reasoning. But the effects of nervousness and alcohol withdrawal can be far worse, especially in a game like darts."For some people, low levels of alcohol improve performance of tasks. It does reduce anxiety and nervousness so if you\'re impaired by nervousness it can improve performance," Prof Robert Adron Harris, from the University of Texas at Austin, told the BBC. A degree of stress actually enhances performance, but after a certain point, nerves get the better of people. This is known as the Yerkes-Dodson law.In pub games, the stakes may be lower, but even amateurs find that the oche holds a strange power over them."Nervousness runs right through the sport, as does the belief that alcohol solves the problem," says Paul Gillings, who runs The Darts Performance Centre, a training centre and advice website. "Players totally believe that they can\'t play unless they have a drink. It ranges from one drink to 10."He discourages this sort of self-medication, advocating relaxation exercises and positive thinking. He also reminds players that in the grand scheme of things, it\'s only a game of darts.John Thomas - or "Jocky" - Wilson, one of the top players of the 1980s, took it to extremes. He said he needed seven or eight vodkas to steady his nerves before playing. He once fell off the stage at the end of a match.Before winning the 2004 BDO World Darts Championship, Andy Fordham reportedly drank 24 bottles of beer along with quite a bit of brandy. He said in an interview later that people never saw him sober. He weighed 31 stone and developed cirrhosis of the liver.Fordham, who was also known as The Viking, believed that heavy drinking was the only way he could concentrate - and he was probably right. For someone who is used to drinking as much as he was, it would be very difficult to play sober. "The more you drink, the more tolerance to alcohol increases," says Anya Topiwala, a senior clinical researcher at the University of Oxford. "Alcohol withdrawal causes anxiety, tremors and sweatiness, all of which I suspect would make it harder to play darts." But experts agree that players like Fordham and Wilson won matches in spite of their drinking habits, not because of them."There\'s too much money involved now for players to get themselves too pie-eyed," says David King, who runs Darts501, a darts information website. He says the sport needs more trainers and psychologists to help people get over stage fright, shaky hands and even a nasty psychological condition known as dartitis, where players find themselves unable to throw a dart.So alcohol doesn\'t make most people better at darts, but while the pub remains the best place to practise, aspiring players may need to resist round-the-clock sessions, especially if they\'re of a nervous disposition.

CONTENT:  ['A mother has described the harrowing moment she had to perform CPR on her daughter, who died of sepsis. Chloe Christopher, 17, from Cwmaman, Rhondda Cynon Taff, had been laughing with friends before being struck by the illness on New Year\'s Eve 2014.The condition happens when the body fights infection but causes injury to its own tissue and organs. Her mother Michelle has made a video with the Welsh Ambulance Service to try and help raise awareness of the signs.She said the moment her daughter, from Aberdare Community School, collapsed in front of her would "stay with me forever".Here she tells her story: Chloe seemed to have what we thought was a cold or maybe the start of a chest infection.She was a little lethargic with some aches and pains, but it seemed nothing to worry about.She spent one evening with one of her closest friends laughing and joking and looking forward to New Year\'s Eve celebrations, as they were going to a fancy dress party.They were both together as Chloe rapidly deteriorated. It was so sudden; one minute laughing and joking, the next she said she felt unwell and a bit scared.She then collapsed in front of us. Hearing the words "Mam, I\'m frightened, I don\'t feel very well" will stay with me forever.I phoned for the emergency services immediately and even though we didn\'t know what was happening, we knew it was serious.Chloe suffered a cardiac arrest in front of us, and having to try and perform CPR on your own daughter was indescribable.The emergency staff were amazing and tried their utmost to save Chloe but to no avail.The life-threatening condition arises when the body\'s response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.It can initially look like flu, gastroenteritis or a chest infection.There are common signs and symptoms including fever, an increased heart, increased breathing rate and confusion. This can lead to shock, multiple organ failure and death if these are not recognised early.The first time we heard of sepsis was at Chloe\'s inquest five months later.We heard that Chloe had signs of a urine infection which turned to sepsis, led to multi-organ failure and then cardiac arrest.Since Chloe\'s passing, it\'s been my passion to raise awareness and to help educate the public on the signs of sepsis.It is estimated that sepsis kills around 44,000 people a year; it\'s bigger than breast, bowel and prostate cancer put together.If caught early, sepsis can be treatable, so they key message is education, knowledge and awareness and to just ask "could this be sepsis?"By doing this, it helps keep our beautiful Chloe\'s memory alive, hoping that maybe we can save a family going through what we have.']	 CATEGORY:Health

CONTENT:  ['Three hospital trusts are to discuss merger proposals that would create one of the largest NHS trusts.The boards of Basildon, Southend and Broomfield hospitals in Essex will meet on Wednesday to approve the formal start of the process.A merger would "modernise services" and make care "more reliable and safer for patients", a consultants\' report said.But a campaign group said the move would reduce the number of services and affect staff pay and conditions.The three trusts have a combined financial deficit of more than £49m, according to board papers.A new single organisation covering all three areas could be in place by April 2019.A public consultation will run until 9 March, with a final decision to be made in the summer. A report said research identified below-average performance in areas including cancer waiting times, patient experiences and care and support for patients with long-term conditions."Change has to happen to maintain the safety and quality of care in the future, and in a way that will improve outcomes for patients and support our staff," it continued. If approved, the new trust would serve more than 1.1 million people across Essex, employing more than 14,000 staff.The hospitals have worked collaboratively since 2016, and are currently run by a joint executive group.Chief executive Clare Panniker said a number of options had been tested "in a rigorous appraisal process".She added: "The recommended option is to work as one organisation."Mike Fieldhouse, secretary of Save Southend NHS, said the group was "very much opposed" to the merger."This would inevitably lead to a reduction in the number of services available locally to patients plus the potential implications for staff contracts, conditions and pay are huge, too," he said.']	 CATEGORY:Health

CONTENT:  ['An East Yorkshire MP has claimed people have told her they "see no point in continuing to live" if the NHS ends treatment for their chronic pain.More than 80 patients have been told that their Pain Infusion Therapy (PIT) will be reduced before ending completely in a year\'s time. PIT involves the delivery of drugs via a drip feed.Local NHS bosses said the ending of PIT was part of a review of patients\' treatment.Labour MP for Hull West and Hessle, Emma Hardy, claimed the ending of PIT was due to NHS budget cuts and called on Prime Minister Theresa May to "personally intervene" and provide extra funding.She said 10 people had contacted her and "many have told me they would see no point in continuing to live" if the therapy was withdrawn. "The cuts to the NHS shouldn\'t be counted in terms of budgets but in lives destroyed," she said. Responding to the MP during Prime Minister\'s Questions, Mrs May claimed the government "was putting extra money" into the NHS."CCGs will be taking individual decisions about how they apportion their funding," she said."But to stand up here and suggest we are cutting funding to the National Health Service is plain wrong."Heath Marsh-McLeod has been undergoing monthly treatment for more than 15 years after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body. He said he was "devastated" by the decision and had tried alternative therapies in the past "but nothing works in the same way that this works". "It helps me function day-to-day," he said."Without this infusion therapy all that will stop. Who are these people to decide that I haven\'t got a right to be pain free?"Dr Dan Roper, chair of the Hull Clinical Commissioning Group, denied that PIT was being removed to save money but was part of a review to ensure patients got the "best treatment"."Individual patients will say they get a lot of benefit from it, " he said."The difficulty is that if you look at really well controlled randomised trials of this form of treatment there isn\'t an overwhelming evidence that it\'s effective in the population."']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['This week saw the BBC launch its NHS Tracker project. The online search allows users to find out how their local services perform against the three key targets covering accident and emergency departments, cancer care and planned operations and treatment.The project will run for a year. But already some remarkable issues have been brought to light.There was only one local hospital service in the whole of the UK that achieved all three key targets throughout the year. Take a bow Luton and Dunstable NHS Trust.The medium-sized hospital undoubtedly benefits from the fact that it is not a large regional centre, which means it will avoid some of the most complex cases.But the performance is impressive nonetheless. The next best-placed service had missed a fifth of its targets over the past year.\n                                    \n                                    \n                                \n                                        \n                                        \n                                    The secret of Luton\'s success? The trust has been surprisingly reticent to shout about what it does and declined the chance to appear on air as the BBC launched its NHS Tracker.We do know it has been at the forefront of putting GPs into A&E, which is now a national policy as it helps deal with patients who arrive with fairly minor ailments.It also has a state-of-the-art operations centres - fully digitalised (not always a given in the NHS) - that allows managers to monitor which beds are occupied and how long patients have been waiting.This helps keep patients flowing through the system - and when bottlenecks build up they can be identified and dealt with quickly.Six of the top 12 performing hospital services in England over the past year are clustered around the North East. They include South Tyneside, Gateshead and North Tees/Hartlepool, which were ranked second, third and fourth behind Luton.All achieved their key targets for 80% of the year. Newcastle, South Tees and County Durham/Darlington were not far behind. Across the whole region, even when you take into account the weaker performers, the average was just over 70%.The hospitals had a mixed performance on cancer, but achieved a 100% success rate in meeting the 18-week target for planned operations.It\'s not entirely clear why this has happened. It has a smaller population and fewer hospitals than many of the regions, meaning the performance of a few places is more likely to skew the overall picture.But it is certainly fair to say the region has benefited from having some of the most respected and experienced chief executives running its hospitals in recent years, including Sir Len Fenwick, who ran Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Trust for over 40 years before stepping down earlier this year, and former Jim Mackey, who now runs the regulator, NHS Improvement.That has helped the NHS in the region to forge good links with local councils. This is considered vital as it allows hospitals to discharge patients quickly in the knowledge there is care available in the community to help them recover after their hospital treatment.Targets started to be introduced across the NHS in the early years of the 21st Century. There has been an odd bit of tinkering since, for example both England and Scotland started off expecting 98% of patients to be seen in four hours but have subsequently reduced this target to 95%.But nowhere has chopped and changed as much as Northern Ireland when it comes to planned operations and care.It has a 13-week target from the point at which a decision is made to admit a patient to the start of treatment.It last hit this in 2013, when the threshold was that 60% of patients had to be seen within that time period. At the time performance was improving, and so the target soon moved up to 70% and then 80%.But the health service there could not get close to meeting the mark, and with performance dropping so did the target. In March 2015 it stood at 80%, but since then it has been reduced to 55% - and yet the target has still not been met.It is very hard to compare the performance of each of the four UK nations. As the targets are measured differently, it is hard to say which is doing best and worst.This is why when the BBC launched its NHS Tracker it focused on which nation was best at hitting the targets it had set. It turned out all were pretty poor. Wales, Northern Ireland and England had not achieved any of their key targets at a national level in the past 12 months. Scotland had hit them just 8% of the time.What that does not tell us though is which nation missed them by the most. The best indication of that is performance against the four-hour A&E target as it is the most comparable target and is a good indication of overall "stress" in the system.When you look at performance over the past year, there is a clear first, second, third and fourth place.Or at least on a regular basis, that is. Performance has now dropped so far against the targets that a number of hospital bosses voiced concern over whether they could realistically meet them on a consistent basis.There is a growing number of trusts that have not hit targets for over five years.  And nationally you have to go back to 2008 for the last time Wales met its cancer target, while its four-hour A&E goal has never been achieved since it was set in 2004.In Northern Ireland neither the A&E nor cancer targets have been met since they were set in 2008 and 2009 respectively.But it is also worth noting there are some targets that have been hit.The BBC chose to focus on the three particular targets it did because these are widely considered to be the most important as they are the ones that best measure the whole patient experience.But there are other targets that have been met. These tend to be measures that look at just one part of the patient pathway, such as access to diagnostic tests when a person needs a hospital operation, or an appointment with a cancer specialist following an urgent referral.']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['Cancer care at an NHS specialist hospital is becoming "unsustainable" because of staff shortages, its boss has warned.A memo to Oxford\'s Churchill Hospital staff, , said chemotherapy cycles could be cut.The memo from head of chemotherapy Dr Andrew Weaver says patients face delays as nurse numbers were about 40% down.A hospital trust spokesman stressed no decisions had yet been made that may affect treatment.  Theresa May was asked to apologise to cancer patients by Labour MP Luciana Berger, who challenged her over the memo at Prime Minister\'s Questions earlier.In response, she said the hospital had "made clear there are absolutely no plans to delay the start of chemotherapy treatment or reduce the number of cycles of treatment".Dr Weaver wrote the hospital did not have enough nurses trained to deal with medication at its day treatment unit."As a consequence we are having to delay chemotherapy patients\' starting times to four weeks," he wrote.An Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesman told the BBC starting times were usually within four weeks, but understood the memo to mean they may have to be pushed back to the "furthest limits" of this time frame.He said the hospital had met the national cancer waiting time standard of starting chemotherapy within 31 days of a clinical decision having been made, despite increases in cancer patient numbers.But the memo also suggested cutting back on treatment to alleviate symptoms from six cycles to four."I know that many of us will find it difficult to accept these changes but the bottom line is that the current situation with limited numbers of staff is unsustainable," Dr Weaver adds.The thought of cancer treatment being delayed or withheld is shocking. But this is really a simple case of supply and demand. Cancer cases are becoming more common - and the numbers of staff employed to care for these patients are not rising quickly enough to keep up.A recent Cancer Research UK report found that the non-surgical workforce had increased by 4% in the past three years. The problem is that cancer incidence has risen by 8% each year. Many staff who provided feedback cited staff shortages as a key problem with chemotherapy nurses saying some of the gaps have even had to be plugged by nurses not properly trained in providing the treatment. Cancer services, just like A&E, are undoubtedly struggling to keep up.The trust spokesman said: "We have not made any decisions to delay the start of chemotherapy treatment or to reduce the number of cycles of chemotherapy treatment which patients with cancer receive."The internal email from Dr Andrew Weaver sets out some of the challenges facing our chemotherapy service, with his ideas for how to tackle these issues, and invites constructive comments and alternative proposals from other cancer doctors and clinical staff. "However, it does not represent a change to our formal policy for chemotherapy treatment."We would like to reassure our patients that no changes to chemotherapy treatment have been made or will be made before thorough consideration has been given to all possible options."He said that, like the rest of the NHS, the trust faced an "ongoing challenge to recruit nursing staff" and as well as recruiting nurses from overseas it was looking at "rapid access to chemotherapy education and training" for new staff.David Bailey, who is receiving treatment at the hospital, said: "This is quite a surprise. My treatment has been exemplary and I can\'t complain… and as far as I\'m aware I\'m set for a six-cycle course."What would concern me though is if I\'m a new patient, or a relative of a patient, who\'s diagnosed."Mr Bailey, who is also a nurse and a Unison representative, added: "Recruiting staff in Oxford is a problem. It\'s the most expensive city outside of London to live."Sir Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK\'s chief executive, said it was "totally unacceptable" that shortages could lead to delays."Immediate action needs to be taken by the government to deal with this, otherwise problems like the one at Oxford will become more widespread and more severe," he said.Dr Karen Roberts, chief nursing officer at Macmillan Cancer Support said: "Such a situation is deeply worrying and delays cause untold distress to patients. "A decision like this highlights challenges facing those working in cancer care. "Hardworking clinicians would do everything in their power to avoid such a scenario, but this indicates that extreme staffing pressures are beginning to affect the quality of treatment patients receive."Roz Pearce at Healthwatch Oxfordshire said she had not previously been aware of a shortage in the department and called it "very worrying for patients".']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['An MP has called for a ban on high-caffeine energy drinks for under-16s, following the suicide of a 25-year-old constituent.Maria Caulfield raised the issue in Prime Minister\'s Questions. She said Justin Bartholomew\'s family were "convinced" his intake of more than 15 cans a day had increased his anxiety and contributed to his death. Theresa May said the government had taken action over high-sugar drinks and would continue to look at the evidence. Supermarket chain Waitrose recently announced it was banning the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to children aged under 16, following concerns over the impact of sugar and caffeine on children. Ms Caulfield asked whether, given the actions of Waitrose and campaigners, including Jamie Oliver, the prime minister would consider a national ban.Mrs May said the MP for Lewes had raised a "tragic case" and recognised energy drinks high in sugar could be damaging to young people\'s health. She said the government had introduced the soft drinks industry levy - a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, which takes effect in April 2018.But the Department of Health and Social Care would continue to look at the issue and the scientific evidence, the prime minister said. The British Soft Drinks Association has said energy drinks have been "deemed safe" by regulators but are not marketed or promoted to under-16s. Existing industry labelling guidelines require any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to carry a high-caffeine content warning and state it is not recommended for children. Last month, campaign group Action on Sugar found that typical serving sizes of energy drinks, at 500ml (nearly a pint), were larger than for other sugary drinks and were "completely inappropriate for children to consume".']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['Drug company Pfizer has announced it is pulling out of research into drugs to treat Alzheimer\'s disease.The US-based pharmaceutical giant said it would be ending its neuroscience discovery programmes following a review, and 300 jobs would be lost.The Alzheimer\'s Society called the news "disappointing" and a "heavy blow" to those living with dementia.Companies should be encouraged to invest in research into neuroscience, Alzheimer\'s Research UK said. The move means Pfizer will also stop looking for treatments for Parkinson\'s disease, but the company said it planned to create a new fund dedicated to neuroscience research in the future.A statement from the company said: "We have made the decision to end our neuroscience discovery and early development efforts and re-allocate funding to those areas where we have strong scientific leadership and that will allow us to provide the greatest impact for patients."Prof Tara Spire-Jones, a neuroscientist at Edinburgh University, told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that despite the decision, there was still a lot of hope. "Not all pharmaceutical companies are pulling out and there are over 100 clinical trials at the moment."There is a lot going on in the basic science - we need to understand the complexity of the brain."She said Pfizer\'s decision was understandable because of the failure rate of clinical trials."More than 99% of trials for Alzheimer\'s drugs have failed in past 15 years."So companies are justifiably cautious, but we are making great advances on the scientific front."Prof Spire-Jones added: "We\'ve learned from these failures of trials that we need to take a step back and understand brain changes."At the moment we don\'t fully understand how memory and thinking work fully in a healthy brain."Pharmaceutical companies including Novartis, Janssen, Biogen, Abbvie and Eli Lilly are still developing medicines to treat Alzheimer\'s disease and a spokesman for the ABPI (Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry) said they continued "to make progress in unravelling the complexities of the brain and identifying the underpinnings of the disease".Dr James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer\'s Society, said: "Of course it\'s disappointing to hear that Pfizer, one of the world\'s leading pharmaceutical companies, will be terminating their research efforts in neuroscience, including Alzheimer\'s disease drug discovery. "The brain is the most complex organ in the body and developing drugs to treat brain diseases is a tremendous challenge, but with no new drug for dementia in the last 15 years, this will come as a heavy blow to the estimated 46.8 million people currently living with the condition across the globe." The Alzheimer\'s Society said it had committed £50m to fund new research at the UK Dementia Research Institute alongside Alzheimer\'s Research UK and the Medical Research Council. Dr Matthew Norton, director of policy at Alzheimer\'s Research UK, said: "We hope that pharmaceutical companies will look at the long-term potential when deciding whether to participate in this effort. "It is vital that all of us - charities, government and industry alike - make long-term commitments to dementia research if we are to bring an end to the fear, harm and heartbreak of dementia."Currently, about 850,000 people in the UK have a form of dementia. One million people are predicted to be living with the condition by 2021, and this could rise to two million by 2051.']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ["This month hospitals have reported huge pressures, with A&Es over-crowded, a lack of beds and queues of ambulances stacked up outside unable to hand over their patients.It was a similar story last winter. The NHS, it seems, is always facing unrelenting pressure. But why is this when funding is rising?The sheer scale of the health service can take the breath away. Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it's the fifth biggest employer in the world.So it should come as no surprise that this vast enterprise absorbs eye-watering amounts of money.Last year in excess of £140bn was spent on health across the UK - more than 10 times the figure that was ploughed in 60 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation.Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of the public purse into it. Today 30p out of every £1 spent on services goes on health.Even during years of deep austerity in the UK, extra money has been found for the health service - £8bn more this parliament in England alone. Yet it seems no matter how much is invested, it's still not enough. The NHS is creaking at the seams.The best barometer of this is the four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of how good an emergency department is. But it's not. It doesn't tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the signs of a heart attack. Instead it's a sign of whether the system is under stress - both in the community and in the hospital. When there's perfect harmony between the numbers arriving and leaving, 95% of patients will be dealt with in four hours.But this isn't happening. You have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on year.The rest of the UK is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals have been hovering below the 90% mark in recent weeks.The ageing population is certainly a major factor - and it's one that all health systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now.This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more.But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have two. The average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as much.As the numbers continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at £20m each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost more than this.Then there's obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly.All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy.This is why health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of government spending.Over the years this has been achievable through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share of the public purse.But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over the years governments have varied the amount they were willing or able to give.Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under Blair and Brown this was considerably higher.As you can see the period between 2010 and 2015 saw the tightest financial settlement. The following two years were a little more generous, but that average is likely to drop a little over the rest of the parliament under current spending plans.So ministers in England are right to say they are increasing funding - it's been frozen in Wales and Scotland - but it's just that it doesn't compare favourably with what the NHS has traditionally got.Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that over the 10 years to 2020, the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to keep pace with the ageing and growing population.But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders. But a number of these countries achieve that by taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC last year is anything to go by, they are pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would support National Insurance going up. Nor does it seem there's appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like some of our European neighbours do. But even if more money was spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people wanting to work in key posts. Trainee posts for GPs are being increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all.There also remain big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for 21st Century healthcare. The NHS is still centred on the network of district general hospitals that emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s. But in an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, what they really need is support in the community.The problem is there's a serious shortage of this. The number of district nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly difficult. The result is that people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have risen by over 40% in 13 years. Not all of this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population with a long-term condition.There are attempts to change this by placing more emphasis on care outside hospital. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to create more integrated care, which involves hospital services working more closely with their local community teams. Similar moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more active, eat better diets and drink less.But perhaps the biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital.In an era when the population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting help from the state.However, the opposite is true. In England over the past four years for which we have data, the number of older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is large numbers going without care or having to pay for it themselves.The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped at £70 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes.Ministers in England have promised the system will change. New plans are due to be published by the summer of 2018.But, as yet, no part of the UK has cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done?Would you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service to a national institution and the other to local councils?  Would you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other?Would you build more than 200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses that need care rather than medical intervention?But as that is the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are falling back on a typical British trait - making do."]	 CATEGORY:Health

Meaningful provision means preventative steps must be taken to protect our young minds from an early age."We need far more robust education in our schools and care homes to identify the signs of mental health and strategies and support put in place to help these children and young people."North Wales Police said three under-17s were detained under the mental health act in 2015-16 but none had been last year.Gwent and Dyfed-Powys Police were unable to provide their figures.Samaritans Cymru said more and more young people were struggling with mental health problems, such as self-harm and eating disorders. The charity said nearly 17,000 young people were admitted to A&E departments in Wales because of self-harm in 2017 - an increase of 41% in three years - while in in 2016, there were 16 suicides in the 15-19 age group in Wales; the highest rate in five years and second highest in 12 years.In evidence submitted to the assembly committee it said: "The overall strain on mental health services in Wales is increasing; 2012-2016 saw a 100% increase in demand for CAMHS."We believe lessons in emotional and mental health should be mandatory for all secondary schools in Wales."The assembly committee is holding an inquiry into the emotional and mental health of children and young people. It comes after ministers launched a £1.4m pilot scheme in September where NHS staff will be on hand to give better mental health support in schools in north east and south east Wales and Ceredigion.The National Education Union has previously urged the Welsh Government to  into schools.A Welsh Government spokesman said: "Counselling provision has also been available for learners in year six and all 11 to 18 year olds since 2013.

CONTENT:  ['Hospital services are facing mounting pressure. Staff shortages, rising demand and a squeeze on budgets mean waiting times are rising in many places.And while the health service still sees most patients quickly - whether they turn up at an accident and emergency unit, need cancer treatment or have to have an operation - growing numbers are having to wait longer than they should.So what is it like for those caught up in the system?Christine Moon, 66, was on holiday in Bali in 2015 when she started feeling chest pains.

This was in August last year. She then waited until November to see a consultant, who said she needed a coronary bypass but there would be an additional 18-week wait.  So, 18 weeks later, she rang the hospital."I was told they were way behind and they had absolutely no idea where I was on the waiting list," Ms Moon told BBC News."No-one at the hospital could tell me when I was likely to have my operation."  Every week, patients in more critical need of a bypass were being referred to the hospital, effectively bumping her further down the queue, she said."I couldn\'t do any housework, I couldn\'t do stuff that I normally did. My symptoms were getting worse, but I wasn\'t going to have a heart attack." In April this year, 32 weeks after being diagnosed, she gave up on waiting and paid £16,000 to have the operation privately. "I had to think long and hard about it, but it was really hanging over me," Ms Moon told the BBC."I was more and more depressed, and just not able to get an answer out of anyone."Having the operation had given her "bags of energy" and her life back, she said.But, she is angry and has spent much of her savings.Ms Moon told the BBC: "Eighteen weeks seems to be this magic number they come out with that is just lies."Would I still be on a waiting list if I had not gone privately? I may well have been."\n                                    \n                                    \n                                \n                                        \n                                        \n                                    Holly Wilson was nine years old when she started seeing doctors on a regular basis.  She had a condition where her white blood cells infiltrated her bowel, causing inflammation and pain.Since then, the 22 year-old, from Chichester, has been in and out of hospital."The list is endless," she said, of the number of medical conditions that cause her day-to-day pain.  Her entire body is affected, including her connective tissue, joints and gut, and once she had a cyst on her ovary "the size of a grapefruit".  "At one point, I was in hospital 30 times in a year," Ms Wilson told the BBC. "There are a lot of problems - I\'m very, very complicated. I\'m always known as the difficult, complex patient." She has noticed waiting times increase, and recently had to wait more than 10 hours for a medical slip to give to her employer to allow her to return to work.  Her most recent medical issue is a fast heart rate and palpitations. Doctors are trying to diagnose what is causing it, but it can take up to 18 months between being referred for tests and getting the results. "The long wait for this diagnosis - it\'s a lot of not really knowing, which makes it stressful," Ms Wilson told the BBC. "Doctors want something they can fix in 10 minutes."  "They\'re trying to see so many people in such a short amount of time." But Ms Wilson\'s three folders of medical history do not make this easy."Doctors look at all these notes, and they\'re just too much for one person to take them in," she said."I don\'t feel the notes are being read or paid attention to as much as they should be." Ms Wilson doesn\'t want to "bash the NHS". "They have done a lot for me. Without them I wouldn\'t be alive," she said."It\'s just frustrating as I have been in and out of hospital since I was very small and I have noticed the change." Andy Goble, 48, had painful arthritis in his feet. He had one foot operated on and then, a couple of years later, in August 2016, doctors said they needed to operate on the other. "The idea of the operation is to fuse two bones in the foot to stop them grinding together and stop the pain," he told the BBC. The condition means he struggles to walk any great distance and lives in continual pain. Even though he works from his home, in Southend-on-Sea, the condition has affected his work as a web designer. "I am self-employed and find it impossible to work all day," he said."I am also unable to drive much of a distance if I need to visit clients. "This is starting to cause me financial problems." The father of two has also had to take painkillers, which tire him out. He waited an "absolute age" to receive a date for the operation, which was then cancelled a week later.And in May, after many phone calls, he decided to launch a formal complaint."Then, all of a sudden, everyone jumps and gets involved," Mr Goble told the BBC. The hospital had "bent over backwards" to get the surgery done, he said, scheduling operations "at weird and wonderful times", with his taking place on a Sunday morning 15 weeks ago. He can now walk again, but his foot remains very painful as it recovers."Because it\'s not life threatening - it\'s just pain-relief surgery - you come bottom of the list," he said. "It\'s always the lowest priority.""There is knock-on pain to other joints, such as the knee, hip and back. So, while you\'re waiting, the condition gets worse and affects your life more and more."It was February 2014 when Susan Down, now 65, first thought something was wrong. "It was quite sinister what I found, the lump," she told the BBC."I\'d had it for quite a few weeks, and it was getting worse." She saw a GP, who gave her creams for piles.A couple of weeks later, when things hadn\'t improved, the GP gave her a referral for an emergency appointment.Despite it being deemed urgent, her local hospital wasn\'t as quick to respond as she had expected."I was quite anxious. I kept calling the hospital," Ms Down told the BBC.Five and a half weeks later, she got an appointment."Then they were running around like headless chickens," she said, giving her six different tests over the next fortnight. Her daughters and partner went with her to the appointment. She was told she had stage-four anal cancer and that her tumour was 2.5cm (1in)."It hadn\'t metastasised, but it was very big and pushing it\'s way to the front," Ms Down told the BBC."If it had gotten right through to the front, I would\'ve been poisoned."Her diagnosis caused her to retire from her job, as a support worker for adults with learning disabilities. It took a couple of months before she was fitted with a stoma, and then she had to wait a couple more months before she could get radiotherapy."The doctor said, \'Lets get on with it or else you will die,\'" Ms Down told the BBC.The radiotherapy machine at her local hospital was not appropriate for her so she had to be treated in a specialist hospital in Hertfordshire, a two-hour drive from her home in Kent. She had six weeks of radiotherapy followed by two weeks of chemotherapy. "At first they couldn\'t say it had shrunk, because it was so big," Ms Down told the BBC."But after a few months they said it as going in the right direction. "Looking back I think, That was awful.\'"Now, Ms Down spends half her week looking after her one-year-old granddaughter, Charlotte.  She appears to be clear of cancer, but has long-term problems from the treatment.']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['Human trials of a once-a-week oral pill for HIV could start, after successful tests in pigs, claim US scientists.The slow-release tablet could free patients from having to take daily medication, they say.It looks like a normal capsule, but on reaching the stomach its coating dissolves and a special structure packed inside unfolds. This 4cm (1.5in) star-shaped scaffold stays in the stomach for seven days, steadily releasing its cargo of drugs.More tests in other mammals, including monkeys, are recommended but the researchers say trials in people could begin within two years.HIV experts said the prospect of a new treatment option was to be welcomed, but that a once-a-week HIV pill for people was "still a way off".The star is too large to move out of the stomach but still allows food to journey through to the small intestine. Once it has delivered its payload, the star begins to degrade and passes on through the digestive tract. In the pig trial, the researchers dosed it with enough of three antiretroviral drugs - dolutegravir, rilpivirine and cabotegravir - to last for seven days. The researchers say, in the future, the oral drug delivery device could be used for a wide range of diseases, not just HIV. Preliminary tests in pigs have already been done with a malaria drug called ivermectin and the star remaining in the stomach for up to two weeks. Researcher Giovanni Traverso, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in the US, said: "We wanted to come up with a system to make it easier for patients to stick to taking their treatments. "Changing a medication so it only needs to be taken once a week rather than once a day should be more convenient and improve compliance."Once-a-month formulations might even be possible for some diseases."A company called Lyndra is now developing the technology and plans human trials of the long-lasting oral delivery pills within the next 12 months. Tests with HIV medication could begin after that, subject to approval and more animal tests.Dr Traverso said: "There are lots of patients this could help, including people with dementia or mental health disorders such as schizophrenia."Some slow-release drugs could already be given by injection, he said.A spokeswoman from the British HIV Association said: "This research is still in the early stages of development and there is clearly some way to go from testing in pigs and mathematical modelling to human trials before its effectiveness can be assessed."A Terrence Higgins Trust representative said: "Medical advances have come on leaps and bounds for HIV in the UK in recent years, however we do know that taking a pill each day does present practical barriers for some people living with HIV. "We welcome the prospect of a treatment that removes these barriers, and presents all people living with HIV with further choice, provided that it is no less effective than current options available."The HIV research, published in the journal , was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the Brigham and Women\'s Hospital.

CONTENT:  ["The NHS is under unprecedented pressure. Rising numbers of patients need hospital care - whether in an accident and emergency department, for cancer treatment or for planned operations and care, such as knee and hip replacements. For each there are strict targets local services are expected to meet across the UK. But what are the chances of being seen in time where you live?

See below for data sources.The way the A&E target is measured is almost identical. In each case services across the UK are given four hours in which to treat and discharge or admit or transfer a patient. They are all expected to do that in 95% of cases, although ultimately Scotland wants it services to get to 98% once 95% is achieved. There are also slight differences in the way the start time is measured.There are similarities in the way cancer care is measured. Each expects patients to be treated within 62 days of an urgent referral.In Scotland this can be following a GP or A&E referral or following a screening test.Elsewhere it is broken down individually by referral route. So for the rest of the UK the BBC has chosen GP referral as the area to focus on as this is the most common route. Again the thresholds services are expected to achieve vary.The one that varies the most is for planned hospital care, which is also known as non-emergency treatment.In England, Wales and Scotland the target measures the point at which you get a referral from your GP to the point when your treatment starts - in effect the whole patient journey. In Scotland and England services have 18 weeks, in Wales it is 26 weeks.Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland there are a range of targets for different parts of the patient journey. The BBC has chosen the last part, from when the decision is taken to admit the patient for treatment to when that treatment starts. It therefore does not include the tests and appointments that follow a GP referral, which can take weeks or even months. Services in Northern Ireland have 13 weeks to achieve this target.The thresholds vary too. None is expected to achieve these goals 100% of the time. In Northern Ireland services have to achieve the target in 55% of cases, whereas in Wales it is 95%, in England 92%, and in Scotland 90%.In England data is provided down to individual hospital trust level, some of these run more than one hospital. The BBC has excluded specialist trusts for cancer, children's care, women's services and orthopaedic treatment and instead focused on the 135 general hospital trusts - what most people would consider their local service.Elsewhere performance is broken down to health board level, known as health and care trusts in Northern Ireland. They are in charge of services for a region or large city and often run more than one hospital. We have chosen these boards because while some data is provided down to individual hospital level it is not done across all three targets.The BBC has tracked back performance to the point at which the latest target was set or to when the records allow.When a target has been missed for five years, we have just labelled it as that.When targets have been hit more recently, we have provided the month they were last hit.There are only two targets where it has not been possible to go back five years:The full list of dates from which the performance of local services is available are:"]	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['At least two-thirds of those who try cigarettes go on to become daily smokers, even if only temporarily, research suggests. Data from the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand found 60.3% of people had tried smoking and an estimated 68.9% of those progressed to a daily habit. The study\'s authors said the research showed the "remarkable hold" cigarettes could establish after one experience.They said it confirmed the importance of stopping cigarette experimentation.The , was based on 215,000 respondents to eight surveys between 2000 and 2016 contained in the Global Health Data Exchange.Lead researcher Prof Peter Hajek, from Queen Mary University of London, said it was the first time the link between trying a first cigarette and becoming a regular smoker had been documented in such a large set of data.  "We\'ve found that the conversion rate from first-time smoker to daily smoker is surprisingly high, which helps confirm the importance of preventing cigarette experimentation in the first place," he said. "The UK is seeing a dramatic reduction in smoking at the moment and this tallies with recent findings that only 19% of 11- to 15-year-olds have ever tried a cigarette, so the good news is that we are on the right track."In 2016, 15.5% of adults from the UK smoked - about 7.6 million people - according to the Office for National Statistics, down from 19.9% in 2010. In the same period, 19.3% of 18- to 24-year-olds were smokers, compared with 25.8% in 2010.   Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the charity Action on Smoking and Health, called for the greater government regulation of tobacco sales."The government is refusing to introduce licensing for tobacco retailers, even though there is strong support for this both from the public and retailers," she said.However, the study\'s authors said there were limitations to the research.One was that the surveys had yielded different results for the proportions who had progressed to becoming daily smokers - from 52% in one in the US to 82% in one in the UK - which meant the 68.9% figure was an estimate, as a weighted average of the figures. The authors also said there were questions about the accuracy of people\'s recall of their smoking history.Public health minister Steve Brine said: "Britain is a world leader in tobacco control, and thanks to our tough action smoking rates in England are at an all-time low."We recently launched a new tobacco control plan to map the path to a smoke-free generation and are working to educate people about the risks and support them to quit for good."']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['The number of people waiting more than four hours in Scotland\'s accident and emergency units reached record high levels in the last week of the year.The latest weekly figures show that just 78% of patients across Scotland were seen within the target time.This was well below the Scottish government\'s 95% target, and the lowest since the weekly figures began in February 2015.In the same week in 2016 there were 92.5% treated within four hours.Health Secretary Shona Robison told BBC Scotland the latest figures were for the week ending on Hogmanay, which had been a "very challenging" time for the health service.She said the number of flu cases had been double the same period last year and this had caused "exceptional pressures" for A&E. Ms Robison also said the freezing weather around Christmas had caused problems which had continued to have an impact."There were real pressures but despite that nearly eight out of 10 patients are still being seen, treated and discharged within four hours," Ms Robison said."That is a huge achievement for staff, given these winter pressures."The Scottish Conservatives said the latest figures were "nothing short of a disgrace".In the week before Christmas the figure for those being admitted, transferred or discharged inside the four-hour target was 83.3%, up from the previous record low of 81.1% in the week before.95%Scottish government target Target reached week ending Dec 31   Target reached week ending Dec 24  Target reached week ending Dec 17 The latest figures, for the week ending 31 December, show there were 25,865 attendances at emergency departments across Scotland.Of these, 5,686 were not dealt with within the four-hour target.The statistics show that 1,156 (4.5%) patients spent more than eight hours in an emergency department.There were 272 (1.1%) patients who spent more than 12 hours in A&E.The worst performing health board area was NHS Forth Valley which saw just 57.3% within the target time.Greater Glasgow (71.1%), Lothian (76.2%) and Lanarkshire (76.8%) also missed the target time in about a quarter of cases.  NHS Grampian (87.9%), NHS Highland (87.6%) and NHS Tayside (87.3%) were the best performing mainland health boards.With statistics, the devil is always in the details.The latest tranche of weekly waiting time data is no doubt shocking, with just 78% of patients across Scotland being seen within four hours - down five percentage points on the previous week.But, dig a little deeper, and you\'ll find the situation in some areas is even worse.For example, Forth Valley\'s casualty waiting rooms saw just 57.3% of patients within the target, down 22 percentage points.That figure eclipses the 8-point drop on the previous week for NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, who both remained among the best performers despite the big fall.One can go a step further, and also look at how each individual hospital fared between Christmas and Hogmanay.Forth Valley Royal\'s performance was down most (22 percentage points), Raigmore Hospital in Inverness was down 14 points, and Ninewells Hospital in Dundee was 10 percentage points lower than the previous week.But how does this compare to the corresponding week from December 2016, I hear you ask?Well, the comparison isn\'t flattering.Again NHS Forth Valley heads the leaderboard with a 36 percentage point decrease (it was 93% in week 52 of 2016) in the number of patients seen within four hours.NHS Lothian and Lanarkshire fare a little better with differences of 20 percentage points and 17 respectively.But one should note that the data for week 52 covers slightly different dates - 25 December 2016 to 1 January 2017, versus 24 to 31 December 2017.However, considering the previous year\'s figures included New Year\'s Day - a day that might be expected to see a high number of alcohol-induced injuries in A&E - the decrease in patients seen in December 2017 is arguably even more telling.Allan Browne was among patients affected by long waiting times during the festive period. He told BBC Scotland he went to A&E on Boxing Day with a suspected fractured ankle after slipping on ice."When I went it in, it looked not too busy, but the woman at reception told me it could be as much as an eight-hour wait to be seen. Eight hours is a long time. "She said it was probably not broken and told me it was up to me if I wanted to hang about. I decided not to.""After a week of not being able to sleep properly because the pain was so sore, I decided I am going to have to go back to A&E to see if I can get an X-ray and just see how long it takes."This time Mr Browne saw a nurse after about three-and-a-half hours."She told me that I had fractured my ankle and that I shouldn\'t have been walking on it," he said.He believes the delay in getting proper treatment has lengthened his recovery time. He added: "I always hear the excuse that this is a \'seasonal problem\'. But the season comes around every year. Can\'t they prepare better for this? Can\'t they provide more staff?" Last month, BBC analysis of NHS data showed that fewer patients in Scotland were waiting longer than four hours in A&E than they did in 2012/3 in contrast to England where the number had more than doubled.It found England had a 155% rise in long waits between 2012/3 and this year, up to 2.5 million a year.Hospitals in Wales and Northern Ireland also saw an increase over the period. In Scotland, the number of patients waiting more than four hours fell by 9% to just over 100,000.']	 CATEGORY:Health 

CONTENT:  ['High-flying professionals are swapping their career for the classroom under a new scheme for challenging secondary schools. Could it be the answer to the UK\'s "teaching shortage"?"I\'ve gone from being at the top of my game and being very capable and knowing what I\'m doing, to not having a clue," Dr Simon Harkin, 59, told the BBC\'s Victoria Derbyshire programme.He has just started working as an English teacher at Ark All Saints Academy in south-east London.The role is part of a new scheme, Now Teach, which has placed 46 trainees into challenging London secondary schools.It is a far cry, however, from his previous role, in the civil service, where he served in Europe, South America and Africa - and worked for the Queen."Working in the royal household at Balmoral was a great privilege," he says, while being deliberately coy about exactly what his job entailed, and which members of royalty he knew."I worked in the Master of the Household\'s Office, which is the bit of the household which actually runs the thing."Simon also opened the British embassy in the Ivory Coast and was given an award by the UK government for his work in helping to tackle the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.But however vast his expertise in his previous line of work, teaching has been a wake-up call."My IT skills are embarrassingly poor, so I have to work out how to do things from scratch," he says."My class are looking to me for guidance and leadership and to show them what to do and how to do it. And if I\'m wobbling around and not quite sure what I\'m doing, they pick that up very quickly, even unconsciously. It\'s alarming."Simon says he decided to take up the challenge of teaching in the hope he could help address what an  in England earlier this year."I\'ve come to the end of a fascinating career, and I thought, \'If I retire and do nothing, all that\'s gone to waste.\'"The Department for Education says there are currently record levels of teachers, and that it is investing £1.3bn until 2020 to attract more teachers.If successful in his year\'s on-the-job training, Simon will become a qualified teacher.For the school\'s head teacher, Lucy Frame, recruiting people later in life - from different lines of work - is a valuable new approach."[Simon] has had lots of different experiences in life, which means that when he sees a problem, he is looking at it from different aspects, which brings a gravitas and confidence in dealing with things."Lynda Burns has had a similarly stark transition to Simon.After two week\'s intensive training provided by the scheme, she is working as a trainee Spanish teacher at Oasis Shirley Park School in Croydon, south London.It is a very different experience to her former glittering career as a diplomat - most recently being the UK\'s deputy ambassador to Cyprus."I spent about 20 years in the Foreign Office, advising the government, ministers and Number 10 about foreign policy," she says.Her role would sometimes involve making life-and-death decisions - including once having to manage crisis teams as a plane containing British nationals was taken hostage and diverted to Cyprus.But Lynda likes to think there are some parallels between her past life and working with children."In diplomacy you\'re dealing with different people around the world, different cultures, and different languages," she says. "You have to find a way to express yourself and make yourself understood."With school, I\'m trying to do that with a different audience."She has taken on the role in the hope she can give something back to children in her local community, having spent 20 years trying to do the best for her country.But is Now Teach the best answer to what critics see as a teaching shortage? As an untested pilot scheme, it is the children that will pay the price if it goes wrong. "From day one - from second one - of your lesson you\'ve got eyes upon you waiting for you to take charge of the class, waiting for you to produce a great lesson."So although you\'re learning the job, you have to be credible in front of the children, and I think that\'s been a major challenge."Now Teach includes regular feedback sessions with senior - and often younger - members of staff who act as mentors throughout the year.The children seem to give Lynda the thumbs up."I wasn\'t really good at Spanish last year," says Alfred, in her Year 7 class. "I really struggled a lot."But Miss has helped me a lot, and now I\'m in a higher set."Victoria Derbyshire programme']	 CATEGORY:Education 

CONTENT:  ['Liberia, which , has among the highest percentage of out-of-school primary children in the world."Liberia is one of the poorest countries in the world and its education system lags behind most countries, in both access and quality.  Fewer than 40% of children complete primary education. And among adult women who finished elementary school just one in four could read a sentence.If you were education minister in such a country, you might be tempted to try a big, bold, experiment - and that is exactly what the government has done, with Liberia\'s high profile and sometimes controversial Partnership Schools for Liberia programme. Liberian ministers, including Education Minister Werner, last year decided to transfer the management of 93 government schools to eight private operators - mostly international school groups, but also some home grown operators. These 93 schools remained state schools - with government teachers, open enrolment, and no fees. For those  who think this sounds like the academies programme which has been rolled out in England - well, you\'re right. Except that it took England seven years to grow its academies programme to the size Liberia achieved overnight.And, perhaps unlike in England, Liberian ministers decided to do something else just as bold - they would support a rigorous, independent, evaluation of their own policy. Alongside the 93 privately-managed government schools would be a similar number of government "control" schools, to test whether the private operators were genuinely doing better. Instead of the government marking its own homework, researchers from the Center for Global Development in Washington DC and the University of California at San Diego oversaw a selected sample of 3,499 students in 185 schools.As the evaluators fanned out across Liberia, navigating unmade roads and swollen rivers, the international controversy about the so-called "PSL" programme began to hot up. Supporters of public-private partnerships claimed that the improved private sector management would inevitably raise results. Others claimed that education was being "privatised", and that improvements would fail to emerge or not be sustainable across the whole school system.When I visited the country last year, the potential for improvement was clearly visible - many of the PSL schools, for example, reporting that they were now able to take action to replace the teachers who had failed to turn up for classes, when the government was running the schools. But the scale of the challenge was also clear - and the new operators had been given limited notice of which schools and how many they were going to be taking on.The first year of "PSL" is now complete, and the results from the initial evaluation of the programme are in. What do they show? For the supporters of the "Partnership Schools", there are some pretty impressive statistics.Students in these schools made learning gains of more than half an extra year of schooling in English, and two thirds of an extra year in maths - versus the government schools. On average learning gains were 60% higher in partnership schools in the experiment compared with the government schools being used as a control.Teachers in the Partnership schools were 20% more likely to be in school during a random spot check (from a dreadful baseline figure of just 40% in comparator government schools), while students spent roughly twice as long learning each week.So does this prove the case for the reformers? Should the government not simply turn over the whole system to private operators? Sadly, it\'s not quite as simple as that.The PSL schools did better, but they also received more money. On top of the usual government budget of a mere $50 (£37) per child per year, PSL schools received an additional allocation from external funders/operators of at least $50 more per child. Indeed, the evaluators estimate some operators spent a lot more than that - up to $1,000 (£748) per child in one case. More from Ideas for the ? Get in touch with sean.coughlan@bbc.co.ukNow, some of these costs may be particularly high at the beginning of the programme, and could come down over time. But the programme can only be regarded as fully scaleable if the government can substantially increase its own education spending, or encourage donors to fill the yawning gap.What else? Well, the evaluators found that government assigned 37% more teachers to PSL schools than non PSL schools, including first pick of better-trained, new, graduates. If this programme is to be scaled up across all Liberia\'s schools, then a big increase in the supply of trained teachers will be necessary.So, must we conclude that little can be learned from the Liberian experiment? This seems to be too pessimistic. Indeed, it\'s interesting that while learning gains differed widely across the eight operators, these gains did not necessarily correlate with the higher spending. One of the lowest cost operators achieved one of the best results for student learning. That suggests that the improvement in education may not just be about pouring in lots of money. There could be other gains in management and teaching practice, that do not require such large dollops of extra cash.Liberia\'s experiment in school reform is still in its early days - with two more years of evaluation to go. We know from experience elsewhere that programme impacts can vary significantly over time. Liberia also needs to make sure that it can manage and hold to account private operators, in a country with limited government capacity. But for education reformers worldwide and for the children of Liberia, this has been a promising intervention - the challenge is now to build up government capacity and bring down costs. Both are likely to be necessary if a promising experiment can truly change the face of Liberian education."']	 CATEGORY:Education

There was "lots of alcohol and no aspirations"."Even though part of me wanted to be successful, I didn\'t know how to go about anything."There was a sense of being helpless."He came across the Duke of Edinburgh Awards in prison in Reading.It offered something practical that would give him a sense of direction."The biggest things were the teamwork, the confidence building, the self-esteem. It gave me confidence with people, confidence in skills," he says.He was also involved in a scheme where he was trained to listen confidentially to the problems of other prisoners."It might have been a 21-year-old crying about his kids. You learn a lot about people, about empathy. It\'s quite fulfilling to take that responsibility, when it\'s in such a dire place."The expedition for the bronze award meant camping out for the night on the football pitch.For silver and gold he was able to get outside, with runs in the Chilterns and the Brecon Beacons.After being cooped up inside, he says, being out in the countryside was "incredible"."I still have that now, I\'ve a fascination with nature, seeing the rivers and smelling the plants, because I didn\'t see it for all that time. It\'s a sense of freedom, even now."The idea of keeping running and escaping wasn\'t an issue. "You were already so far in progressing, you\'re working towards something."There might be victims of crime who do not think that prisoners should be enjoying the countryside."It depends what you think prison should be," says Jon.If it\'s about rehabilitation as well as punishment, he says the Duke of Edinburgh Awards provide a framework to change the worldview of young offenders.It gives them structure and discipline and skills.Jon says that the awards had more credibility in the rehabilitation process than lessons in "enhanced thinking skills", which he says felt like "nonsense".Jon learned about cooking and after spells making food for the homeless, went on to work in a Jamie Oliver restaurant and is now working for himself as a caterer for private events.He says it\'s disadvantaged youngsters - or young offenders - who really stand to gain the most from the Duke of Edinburgh process."If you\'re posh and have loads of money - and it\'s just for points for university - you probably don\'t take that much from it," he says.But if you\'re in a more disadvantaged position, he says, there is much more at stake and the prize is much bigger."When I think back, the proudest thing for me was when my dad came to the award ceremony. He was at St James\'s Palace and the duke spoke to me. I\'d really grafted." Jon\'s example is being followed by other young inmates. There are about 800 currently working towards awards in prison or other secure settings.It\'s part of an effort by the Duke of Edinburgh Awards to reach a wider range of communities.The charity that runs the awards has announced £3m extra investment, with the aim of getting 70,000 disadvantaged young people per year starting the awards by 2021."Every young person can benefit from doing their D of E," says chief executive Peter Westgarth."\'For all\' is one of the charity\'s founding principles. "But for a young person growing up in a deprived area, possibly with no qualifications, or facing other disadvantages, achieving a D of E award is life-transforming. "It\'s a levelling, positive, life-affirming experience that cuts across generations and gives young people work and life opportunities they will not have had before."']	 CATEGORY:Education 

CONTENT:  ['Exhausted after Christmas and the new year? Are you craving a few more hours in bed? Are you a parent whose sleepless children are leaving you a sleep-starved wreck?These days in early January are claimed as the darkest days for sleep deprivation.The modern barometer for such moments - the number of Google searches - shows "child won\'t sleep" as reaching a worldwide peak of searches at this time of year.You can just imagine those weary fingers tapping out the words, slumped over a mobile phone in the middle of the night, hoping for an answer.Children are more wired than Maplin\'s shop window. They\'ve been living on late nights, red-eyed computer games and party food and the chances of falling asleep are pretty much zero.Then they have to go back to school, like zombies heading into the mid-winter gloom.Adults as well as children are suffering. Early January is also the peak time for searches for "sleep" and the more plaintive "I need sleep".But desperate times require desperate measures. And parents, struggling with their children\'s lack of sleep, develop their own emergency tactics.Research for sleep apps, Moshi Twilight Sleep Stories and calm.com, recently identified some of the most eccentric ideas.They are all claimed as having been tried somewhere. Although you can only imagine how bad things must have become.And none of them are likely to appear in those unbearably smug parenting books for the perfect family.Prof Kevin Morgan, from the Clinical Sleep Research Unit at Loughborough University, says that if you had to design an experiment to disrupt sleep and leave people feeling exhausted it would probably look like the festive season.He says it\'s a "perfect storm" of late nights, over-eating and unpredictable getting-up times.Into that mix can be added alcohol, which damages the quality of sleep, and an underlying level of stress about getting ready for Christmas and new year.It\'s a cocktail for sleep exhaustion - and Prof Morgan says this can be compounded by this being the "bleakest, darkest time of the year".Regularity and routine are the keys to good sleep, he says. But in the Christmas holidays, everything about family life is "topsy-turvy"."By the time you get to 2 January you\'re probably knackered. The children are rattling around and tempers are fraying," says Prof Morgan.There are other less unusual approaches to improving children\'s sleep.The It suggests a bath before bed and then reading a story, in a room that\'s not too brightly lit.Computers, mobile phones and televisions should all be switched off, as they can all disrupt going to sleep.The NHS suggests stopping using screens an hour before children go to bed.There is also advice on the bedroom, which it says should be "dark, quiet and tidy". There should be curtains to keep out the light and a temperature that\'s not too hot or too cold.Prof Morgan says the basic ground rules for good sleep depend on establishing regular habits.And he says it will help if parents make sure children get out into the daylight, rather than staying in front of TV and computer screens.But he says there are no "magic answers"."Children get incredibly wound up at Christmas, and wound-up people don\'t sleep."

CONTENT:  ['Sam does not know where he will be sleeping tonight. Now 23, he says he first became homeless at 15 because of a family breakdown and has been in and out of bedsits, hostels and supported accommodation ever since. "I\'ve stayed at friends\' in the past - I\'ve never really had my own actual flat," he says. "I\'ve slept rough quite a few times but most of the time when I\'ve slept rough I have not actually slept. "I just wander round because I can\'t really shut off when I\'m out in the cold."This week a, highlighting more than 9,000 rough sleepers and 78,000 families in temporary accommodation in England alone. Sam drifts between friends\' sofas, temporary accommodation and rough sleeping in and around Leyland in Lancashire. Young people like him  do not always show in official statistics - but new UK-wide research for the BBC found: At The Key drop-in centre for young homeless people in Leyland, Ian, 25, says he has been sofa-surfing for seven years. His days revolve around a few hours at the drop-in centre. Otherwise, he walks the streets for hours, trying to stay warm and then heads to a mate\'s house in the evening. "I end up spending a few hours there. Then I would finally ask him if I could stay the night. If he says yes I would stay there."He says he feels a burden on his friends. Sometimes he says he runs out of friends he feels able to ask and has to sleep out.The most common reasons for young people resorting to friends\' sofas included parents being unable or unwilling to provide housing, extended family being unable to help and splitting from a partner. Tenancies ending, domestic abuse, rent arrears and leaving care also contributed. Ian has been offered a friend\'s flat for the next three weeks.  Sam, who has spent time in prison, has come to the drop-in centre to make calls to try to find a room for the night.   On the coldest nights, the local council will find him somewhere to stay but that ends as soon as the temperature rises above zero. "It takes pretty much every day of my life, trying to find out where I am going to be staying."It doesn\'t feel like it ever ends. I feel quite drained with it all."  He is on medication for depression. Sam says not having an address means he can\'t register with a GP to get the mental health support he needs. Depression affects Ian too and both young men say it\'s hard to study or look for work without an address."I feel like I\'m going round in circles and circles and circles," says Ian. "All I can do is keep trying."Ursula Patten, operations director at The Key, says sofa surfers should definitely be considered homeless. "You are homeless if you haven\'t got a place you can stay on a consistent basis - somewhere that you can call home."She says about 70% of the homeless young people on the charity\'s books have sofa-surfed before running out of options and seeking help.  But she believes that with the right support there is no reason why homeless young people should not have hope for the future. "It\'s just a phase in your life. You may have got lost but you\'ve got strengths. Everybody\'s got strengths. And I would say go and get some support and somebody to help you find your direction in life because you can attain great things."   The charity Centrepoint said the BBC data corroborated its own Co-author Anna Clarke said: "Sofa-surfing is a not uncommon experience for young people in housing difficulties. "It is really useful to have this kind of evidence on something that\'s inherently difficult to quantify."     And Centrepoint chief executive Seyi Obakin said it was crucial to "dispel the myth that there is anything fun or easy about sofa-surfing". "Goodwill is the only thing keeping too many young people from sleeping on the UK\'s streets. "It\'s frightening just how many are trapped in a cycle that is detrimental to their health, sees them struggle to keep up in education, and where outstaying their welcome can mean becoming exposed to dangers no-one should have to face."

CONTENT:  ['After dropping out of university, for weeks Ben couldn\'t tell his dad the truth. He made a failed suicide attempt and barely left his bedroom for five months. But finally, as he describes here, he managed to start again.I had always felt under pressure to go to university. I was quite fixed on the idea that I was going to become a lawyer, but when I started doing the course I quickly realised it was really difficult and not something that I wanted to do.I was a bit of a solitary child anyway - rather quiet and moody - but going to university made things many times worse. I struggled to fit in because I came from a working-class background and I didn\'t have any support from my parents. I remember arriving at university for the first day by bus, while other people were being dropped off by their parents in cars full of luggage. I didn\'t understand how to choose modules and organise your own timetable - it was a big shift from college, and I struggled to adapt. There wasn\'t enough structure or support, and I felt that other students had bigger networks of friends and family to ask for help.My dad had joined the army after he left school, so he didn\'t know how things worked. My parents had split up when I was 16 and I was living with him. We didn\'t get along at all. He was having problems with alcohol, so he was quite aggressive at home.I had fled to university to get away, but I didn\'t feel welcome there either. I was really isolated. Living away from home for the first time you eat really badly and your sleeping pattern is wrong, and you\'re surrounded by alcohol and drugs all the time. Everything started going wrong about six months in. I had my first relationship at university and I wasn\'t ready for it. We had lots of arguments and when we broke up, I got into a fight with her new boyfriend. After that, I started drinking alcohol quite a lot and missing some lectures and seminars.My drinking was picked up by the university, so they assigned me a counsellor but every time they asked me, "How is everything?" I would just say, "I\'m fine." I was quite defensive. So I actually rejected the bit of help that was offered.When Zoe\'s son left home and went to university his behaviour changed - he became uncommunicative and dropped out after his first year. Here Zoe talks about what happened and the conversation she wishes she\'d had with him.Around eight months in, I felt completely hopeless. I felt I couldn\'t do what I was there to do, and I didn\'t want to. But I didn\'t want to go back home either, because that was a very bad environment. I was stuck. I didn\'t pass any of my exams that summer, but when I went home I was too scared to tell my dad. For the next two months I just avoided telling him that I wasn\'t going back.It was a depressing time. He was drinking and I hid away inside my room. It was at the end of that summer when I made a suicide attempt.I took what I thought was a lethal dose of medicine that was in the house. Half an hour later I thought: "What am I doing?" So I got on the bus to the accident and emergency department.I lingered around outside the hospital for a while, too afraid to go in and tell them what I had done. I felt there was going to be a very heavy-handed response.My head was a mess and I didn\'t really know what to do. My dad was out at work so I just got on the bus back home and went to sleep. Thankfully I woke up. I was unwell for 24 hours, but I didn\'t tell anyone about it - I was very secretive about what I was feeling.It\'s something that is quite private and I\'ve not shared it before.In hindsight, I was too scared to seek support for all of the things that I was feeling. If I had been able to open to somebody, they might have been able to arrange help for me. Things turned out OK, but they could so easily have ended differently.When you\'re feeling suicidal you don\'t think rationally - it is just a hugely powerful feeling which swallows you up. I was searching for any way out really - I had thoughts of joining the army or even committing a crime in order to go to prison.At the end of the summer I got a letter from the university saying that because I had failed my exams I wouldn\'t be invited back, so I had to tell my dad. He was a very difficult man to have these kinds of conversations with. He didn\'t say much, he just told me I had to get a job.For the first five months I didn\'t find work, I was really in an absolute depression. I would buy junk food from the shop with what little money I had, and stay up late playing games on the computer in my bedroom.I had become quite anti-social. I was very angry about everything. I thought that working was for suckers, a waste of time, I thought people who wanted to earn a lot of money were stupid. My depression manifested itself as a sort of hatred for everybody around me. I had no empathy.Eventually I found a place on an apprenticeship. I worked for a year, and what little money I had, I put aside to get away from home.I had another friend who was jobless and in quiet despair. We were both fed up with the UK and decided to go travelling. We put our money together and bought two flights to Budapest. We took some clothes and a sleeping bag and I told my dad I was going on a two-week holiday.We didn\'t come back for a year.After the two weeks came and went my dad obviously became concerned, so I got a phone call from the police. They wanted to know that I hadn\'t been kidnapped or anything like that. I assured them that I was fine and I didn\'t want to speak to my dad. They said that was OK.I had chosen Budapest randomly - I just wanted to get as far away as possible - but it was January and it was very cold, so we got a train ticket to Greece. From there we travelled to Turkey and all around the Balkans, and then over to Spain and Morocco, sleeping rough.We were getting into cars with strangers without being afraid. We had thrown caution to the wind. We had very little money so we were always working odd jobs or asking for food.For the first couple of months I was still experiencing the same hopelessness I had felt at home, but eventually I would say travelling definitely had a therapeutic effect, especially on my anxiety.I suppose part of the reason was spending a lot of time in the sun and being more physically active, but I also experienced a much bigger world and learned to be fully independent and cast off a lot of my fears.Before, I was scared of going outside, I was scared of the dark and of the city at night. But after a while I got used to everything life could throw at me. One of my main fears had been that I would get kicked out by my dad and end up on the street. In the end I preferred risking that to staying at home.Some of the people we met were living desperately poor lives. Most people were very hospitable, they would take us to their house and give us dinner and look after us, and that also made me appreciate what I had left behind.When I came back to the UK I was really eager to get a job, turn my life around and get somewhere to live. Since then, things have gone very well. I\'m really motivated. I\'m 27, I\'ve got a responsible job, and a wife and child.I have learned a lot about anxiety and depression and I think that has helped me understand myself better. But I never had any professional help.I think I found it hard to tell anyone about my problems because it was triggered by my situation at home. Ours was a very closed family unit - what happened in our house stayed in our house - so I didn\'t feel it was something I could tell outsiders about. We didn\'t have grandparents or other family visiting very often. I was very isolated from the outside world.  I\'m sure there are others who have made it through and look back at how close they were to the brink.Dropping out of university felt like the end of the world, but I\'ve managed to start again and make a life for myself. The most important thing is to be able to keep things in perspective and ask for help when you really need it. The pressure on young people to succeed at university is really high. But I think it is much more important to look after yourself than it is to get a degree.']	 CATEGORY:Education 

CONTENT:  ['Kids seem to spend endless hours on smartphones, games consoles, computers and tablets these days.Playing on electronic devices certainly doesn\'t help their waistlines, but do you ever wonder what regular device use is doing to their eyesight?While there isn\'t much research out there yet about the impact of screens on eyesight - after all the iPhone was first unveiled by Apple in only 2007 - experts are concerned about growing levels of short-sightedness in children.And they suggest the best thing parents can do to prevent it is to encourage youngsters to spend more time outdoors in the sunlight. There has been a massive rise around the globe in short-sightedness - or myopia as it\'s officially known - over recent decades."We know that myopia or short-sightedness is becoming more common," says Chris Hammond, professor of ophthalmology at King\'s College London and consultant ophthalmic surgeon at St Thomas\' Hospital."It has reached epidemic levels in East Asia, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, where approaching 90% of 18-year-olds are now short-sighted. "In Europe, it\'s potentially getting up to 40% to 50% of young adults in their mid-20s who are short-sighted now in Western Europe. It\'s been gradually rising over the decades of the 20th Century from around 20-30%."Annegret Dahlmann-Noor, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London says lack of natural light seems to be the key issue."The main factor seems to be a lack of exposure to direct sunlight, because children who study a lot and who use computers or smartphones or tablet computers a lot have less opportunity to run around outside and are less exposed to sunshine and because of that seem to be at more risk of developing short-sightedness."Prof Hammond says: "It may be that there\'s no coincidence that in East Asian countries, the most myopic ones all correlate with the maths league tables."These kids are being pushed with very intensive education from a very young age and spend a lot of time indoors studying everything close up and very little time outdoors."Therefore the concern is that all close work - like playing with the iPad and iPhone - carries the potential that it could make them more short-sighted."Well that\'s much easier said than done! Any parent will know that youngsters are like dogs with bones when it comes to their beloved phones and trying to get them off their devices is pretty much impossible - certainly without a massive argument.Dr Dahlmann-Noor, who is a mother of three, says trying to stop screen use is probably an unrealistic aspiration."You can only tell them that it might make their eyes uncomfortable, it might make them short-sighted and  they should not use it as much as they like to."But, hand on heart, I don\'t think we can get away from this because they also have to do their school homework on laptops and iPads and they do their searches for background information on screens."If you\'re a teenager and you have got revision to do for GCSEs or A-levels then you can\'t really switch off, can you? So I don\'t think we will be reducing the screen use, really, in years to come."The best thing to do, say the experts, is to get children playing outside as much as possible."Protective of myopia development is time outdoors - sport and leisure outdoors are protective of eyesight," says Prof Hammond."In a perfect world, probably on average across the week and the weekend, two hours a day outdoors is protective of becoming short-sighted in children."He says myopia research done in Sydney, Australia showed that only 3% of Chinese-heritage children living in Sydney - who spent two hours a day outdoors - were short-sighted by the age of six, compared to nearly 30% of six-year-olds in Singapore."So again, suggestive that the outdoor lifestyle is good for our eyes."Dr Dahlmann-Noor says diet is also an area where families can help with eyesight."We always tell parents about omega-3 essential fatty acids, and vitamins A, C and E  and nutrients that are good for the back of the eye."Healthy diet really is important - in terms of getting oily fish, avocados, green vegetables, green leafy vegetables as much as possible."Or in children, all these supplements that you can buy over the counter that are good for the brain, also happen to be good for the eyes - they\'re just not marketed for that."She also recommends regular annual eye checks.According to NHS Choices, signs that your child may be short-sighted include:When someone\'s short-sighted, the eyes have grown slightly too long, which means light rays focus just in front of the retina, at the back of the eye, so distant objects to appear blurred, but close objects are seen clearly.While levels of myopia are likely to continue to rise, the hope is that researchers will find ways to reduce its progression. Dr Dahlmann-Noor says: "What we need to look at, in terms of research and development, is ways of modifying the impact that these activities have on their visual development."Prof Hammond adds: "There are eye drops and other treatments to slow myopia progression. But in terms of preventing myopia itself, there isn\'t any data out there at the moment in terms of \'Could the drops we use to slow progression stop myopia developing at all?\' "I think it\'s going to be the logical next step of research studies, as in countries like urban China - where 10% of children in each class per year are becoming short-sighted from about the age of six - there\'s an argument for saying we should be trying to prevent it."']	 CATEGORY:Education

There will also be child development centres created, where parents will be able to bring children, and where advice, resources and information will be available.Julia Stasch, president of the foundation, said this would be "the largest early childhood intervention program ever created in a humanitarian setting"."Less than 2% of the global humanitarian aid budget is dedicated to education, and only a sliver of all education assistance benefits young children. "The longer-term goal is to change the system of humanitarian aid to focus more on helping to ensure the future of young children through education."

CONTENT:  ['Iran has banned teaching the English language in primary schools, calling the subject a "cultural invasion".The education ministry "envisages strengthening Persian language skills and Iranian Islamic culture of pupils at the primary school stage", its secretary told state media.Iran\'s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has previously expressed concern about the teaching of English.It is seen as an important skill by many Iranians and is widely studied.English is a foreign language option for many at secondary level, which begins at the age of 12, but its popularity has led to classes being offered by some schools much earlier."Teaching of foreign languages has not been recommended by any means" at primary level, Mehdi Navid-Adham, secretary of the Supreme Education Council, told the state-run IRIB news agency.He also said that primary schools which teach English as an extra class outside of school hours were committing a "violation".The ban does not affect foreign-language tuition at secondary school or popular private institutes which teach English outside the educational system. but include several English-language outlets, including the Islamic Republic News Agency and PressTV.This move is in line with the supreme leader\'s anti-Western, isolationist view of the world. He has repeatedly said that teaching English to children from an early age could lead to "western cultural infiltration". He says the language of science is not necessarily English and that children should be taught other languages like Spanish, French, or eastern languages. President Hassan Rouhani disagrees with him, and has said that knowing English will help young people join the job market. But he had little power to stop the ban. However, it is unlikely to stop families from pushing their children to learn English. Many middle class families already take their kids to independent language institutions after school hours because the methods used to teach English at normal schools aren\'t very successful. Ayatollah Khamenei laid out his views on the issue in a 2016 speech given to teachers, criticising the spread of English to nursery schools.He said such developments were part of a Western idea of instilling "thought and culture to the younger generation of countries"."These remarks do not mean terminating English language teaching at schools, but the main issue is to know our rival and how precisely the opposite party has made planning to influence the country\'s future generation," he said.The move comes amid significant turmoil in Iran. which began in late December over standards of living.More than 1,000 people are said to have been arrested, including at least 90 students.Ayatollah Khamenei blamed unspecified external "enemies" for the unrest.']	 CATEGORY:Education

The Charles Dickens School in Broadstairs, Kent, said sweets, fizzy drinks and energy drinks would be removed. The secondary school : "Bag checks will take place every morning and any found will be confiscated and not returned."One parent said sweets made some children "too wired to learn".Multi-packs of unhealthy food and drink have also been banned and will be taken from pupils during the daily bag checks, the school said. The school issued a statement saying it had notified parents it would be monitoring what food and drinks students brought into the school. "We had noticed a deterioration in concentrations, learning and behaviour particularly from students bringing into school large multi-packs of unhealthy food, snacks and drinks."The school said healthy eating was part of its programme to "support students\' ability to concentrate, learn and behave well".The school\'s announcement has had a mixed reaction on social media. Jennifer Keen posted on Facebook: "My son attends this school and I have questioned this, the explanation I received was lots of children are coming to school with 2 litre bottles of coke, big bags of sweets and energy drinks in their bags and being too wired to learn effectively, "I am in total agreement with this especially the devil energy drinks as they can lead to severe cardiac issues!

CONTENT:  ['Ministers are being urged to give councils and housing associations back the right to offer lifetime tenancies to those they consider vulnerable.Peers are debating the issue of lifetime tenancies for those in social housing, which started to be phased out by David Cameron\'s Tory government.They will consider proposals to restore lifetime housing rights to those who have suffered domestic abuse.Council bosses want this to go further and cover other vulnerable tenants.These may be people with mental illness or disabilities.In 2015, the last Conservative government legislated for councils to be required to offer all new tenants fixed-term tenancies rather than the lifelong rights of tenancy enjoyed until then.It argued this was necessary because the lifetime tenancies were not an efficient use of social housing at a time when it was in much demand.However, the government also suggested social landlords would be given the discretion to continue such tenancies in certain circumstances.Later, a bill was drawn up which limited this to victims of domestic abuse amid concerns that those subject to violence would be too scared to leave their abusers in case they lost their social housing rights.During the debate on Tuesday, Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, will call for ministers to grant councils that discretion.This should go wider than only victims of domestic violence, he said.Ahead of the debate, he said: "This Bill will allow councils to continue to offer the best housing support to victims of abuse and protect those who often want nothing more than a safe and secure home to live in. "It is also an opportunity to give councils the power to set their own categories for granting lifetime tenancies, including for people with serious mental health illnesses and other vulnerable tenants."Councils are currently the only landlords who issue secure, lifetime tenancies but our housing crisis is limiting their ability to offer the right tenancies to residents."In some areas, housing associations will be the only registered social landlord so it is important to make sure they also offer these tenancies to victims of domestic abuse to offer the widest possible protection."He added that ending the current restrictions on councils\' borrowing to invest in housing was the best way to ensure more secure social homes for vulnerable tenants.The Department for Communities and Local Government would not be drawn on whether its ministers would support the call.But speaking in December, Communities Minister Lord Bourne said it was his department\'s priority to support victims of domestic abuse."Families with secure tenancies who have made the brave decision to leave an abusive situation should not have to forfeit their right to a home, leaving them at risk of returning to live with the perpetrator. "That\'s why we are taking action to enable them to live independently in safety with the opportunity to rebuild their lives." ']	 CATEGORY:Education 

CONTENT:  ['University heads will be barred from being involved in setting their own salaries, under a new fair-pay code announced in the wake of claims of excessive pay for vice-chancellors.Senior pay would also be expected not to rise more quickly than the average for other academic staff.The voluntary code has been drawn up by the Committee of University Chairs.But the chief executive of the new Office for Students, Nicola Dandridge, said the proposals were "insufficient".She said that "people are rightly concerned by the level of pay", and not just the "process" by which it was decided. University heads\' pay was put under intense scrutiny last year, with accusations of "fat cat" salaries and claims that some university leaders were overpaid and out of touch.The vice-chancellor of the .After a meeting last month with the then universities minister, Jo Johnson, .Mr Johnson had called for restraint and had threatened the intervention of a new regulator.University leaders have now produced details of self-regulated rules, promising more transparency and a commitment that "no-one can have any part in deciding their own remuneration"."Society has a right to know that taxpayers\' funds are being properly used and that the institution is being managed in the interest of students, the economy and society," say the new rules. "Senior post-holders must be fairly - but not excessively - rewarded for their work."The proposals, out for consultation within the higher-education sector until March, emphasise the need for independence and expertise in the committees deciding senior pay. Universities will be expected to show how this pay relates to other staff.They will have to publish the "pay multiples" between the vice-chancellors\' earnings and average salaries.If that multiple changes, the rules say that universities will have to publish an explanation.And vice-chancellors\' earnings will have to include the value of any other benefits and bonuses.Chris Sayers, chair of the Committee of University Chairs, said the regulations would help to "justify our decisions" over pay."We need to keep senior post-holders\' pay under review, and be able to justify our decisions. "We must enshrine the values of transparency, fairness and accountability at the heart of our procedures to ensure we maintain the trust required for the long-term success of our world-leading sector."']	 CATEGORY:Education 

CONTENT:  ['Damian Hinds has been announced as England\'s education secretary in the prime minister\'s cabinet reshuffle.He will replace Justine Greening, who is leaving the government.Ms Greening, the first comprehensive-educated Tory education secretary, refused a switch to the Department for Work and Pensions, the BBC understands.Mr Hinds, a former DWP minister, went to a Catholic grammar school in Altrincham and then studied at the University of Oxford.The MP for East Hampshire is a former chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility.Mr Hinds wrote on Twitter that he was "looking forward to working with the great teachers and lecturers in our schools, colleges and universities giving people the opportunities to make the most of their lives".The incoming education secretary will face pressures over school funding and decisions about university tuition fees.Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers\' union, said he was disappointed to see Ms Greening\'s departure."She has tried hard to tackle the school funding crisis, without any help from the chancellor or prime minister," said Mr Barton.Jules White, a , says too often schools policy has been sidetracked by "dubious ideological pursuits" or "tinkering around the edges".Mr White said Mr Hinds would have to "urgently address" core problems over school funding and teacher shortages.The National Association of Head Teachers called for more stability and investment."Where budgets are at breaking point and recruitment is still a massive challenge, education does not need more upheaval," said NAHT leader Paul Whiteman.School funding proved to be an important doorstep issue in the election - and Ms Greening announced that an .The new education secretary also faces big decisions over higher education, including the future of tuition fees and university funding.Prime Minister Theresa May has promised there will be a  - after pledges from Labour to young voters that they would scrap tuition fees.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said Mr Hinds had "assiduously" raised social mobility since becoming an MP in 2010.It all looked so promising at the start. Justine Greening was the straight talking education secretary who\'d gone to a comprehensive in Rotherham not a public school.  She talked frankly of a "social mobility emergency", which seemed to fit closely with the PM\'s agenda of reaching the squeezed middle.  But Justine Greening was never a standard bearer for ideological reforms, whether the free school programme or new grammar schools.  School budgets were under pressure from rising costs, and the data was weaponised by teaching unions into a website that showed the impact on each school.  That ignited campaigning that had a devastating effect on the Conservative vote at the ballot box in the general election. Some extra money came, but too late to make much impact.  A series of political sticking plasters were applied to the sore point of tuition fees, now frozen with a rather mysterious review under way.Education is the third largest area of government spending, and polling suggests the public now see it as the third biggest concern facing Britain.Ms Greening had made  the focus of her 18 months in office and had built bridges with the teaching profession.But there had been questions about whether her approach aligned with the priorities of 10, Downing Street and whether her schools policy was connecting with the public.The Conservatives\' flagship policy of bringing back grammar schools was abandoned in the wake of the election.There was said to be backbench disquiet that the push for more selection had been sidelined - and there will be scrutiny of whether Mr Hinds, a former grammar school boy, will be more sympathetic.Mr Hinds will also have to tackle the delayed decision on whether to change the rules to make it easier for faith groups to open free schools, pledged in the Conservatives\' election manifesto.With the focus on Brexit, there was no education legislation in the last Queen\'s Speech.And the incoming education secretary will be expected to re-energise the Conservatives\' plans for schools.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Ms Greening had been "pushed out", adding: "The only rational explanation would be that this is an acknowledgement that the Conservatives have a failed schools policy."']	 CATEGORY:Education

CONTENT:  ['Plans to outlaw smacking children in Wales are going out to a three-month consultation.Ministers said removing the defence of reasonable punishment would make it clear smacking was "no longer acceptable".Charities including the NSPCC said this would bring Wales in line with dozens of other countries.But campaigners against the law Minister for Children and Social Care, Huw Irranca-Davies, said: "As a parent of three boys myself, I know being a parent can sometimes be a challenging experience. "Our knowledge of what children need to grow and thrive has developed considerably over the last 20 years. We now know that physical punishment can have negative long-term impacts on a child\'s life chances and we also know it is an ineffective punishment."Scotland became the first part of the UK to confirm plans to  last year.Now ministers in Wales want parents to choose "positive and more effective methods".The proposed law would not involve creating a new offence but would instead remove the defence to the existing offences of assault and battery.So, any adult looking after a child would no longer be able to use physical or corporal punishment against them.If prosecuted, parents or guardians could expect to face proceedings for assault in magistrates court; the consultation document said it anticipates a initial increase in cases but this "would decline in the longer term as attitudes to corporal punishment continued to change". Cathryn Scott, mother of three and writer of the blog \'Cardiff Mummy Says\' told BBC Wales: "It makes me really sad, this \'oh it didn\'t do me any harm\', which a lot of the older generations do say. My personal opinion is that I would never hit a child. "When my children are misbehaving it\'s because something else is an issue and I don\'t think a smack is an effective way. "For example yesterday my daughter was being very cheeky, very shouty. And it turned out some of her friends at school had been mean to her. So if I\'d have smacked her she\'d have never told me all of that, she actually got quite upset about what happened at school. "She told me what had happened and now I\'m in a position to do something about it. If I\'d just have smacked her she\'d just have internalised that and the problem wouldn\'t have been dealt with.""How can I hit my child and then tell him it\'s wrong to hit his brother?  "I would never want that reign of terror in my house to be honest." Phyllis Preece, mother of two and chairwoman of the National Pensioners Convention for Wales, disagreed: "It didn\'t do my sister or I any harm to have a smack and exactly the same with my two children. There\'s a difference between a smack and a beating."What\'s the point of being a parent if you haven\'t got control over your children?"And if you can\'t chastise your children then what\'s the point of being a parent in the first place?"You\'ve got to make sure you set the boundaries for the other children."I\'ve known in my generation many a person have had a cane on their dresser and it\'s been there as a warning and you knew how far to go otherwise you\'d get it across the leg. Personally it never happened to me and I never would have done it, but it was used in such cases as a threat."Physical punishment has already been outlawed in schools and childcare facilities but Mr Irranca-Davies said it was time "to ensure it is no longer acceptable anywhere".The Welsh Government is allowed to legislate in areas of parental discipline, under the new . The NSPCC said it was a "common sense move which is about fairness and equality for children".Children\'s Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said: "Welsh Government does not want to create a new criminal offence; Welsh Government does not want to criminalise parents."What government does want to do is to ensure children living in Wales are afforded the same protection in the law as adults. Hitting or smacking a child is never loving or caring. I see no reasonable arguments against the ambition of this consultation."The Welsh Conservatives said AMs would have a free vote on the matter. However, the party\'s Clwyd West AM Darren Millar called smacking "the ultimate sanction", promising to "continue to support the ability of parents in Wales to choose to use it when disciplining their children in the future".A UKIP spokesman said: "Existing law protects children from excessive punishment. "We believe rights of parents should be protected within the law as it stands."']	 CATEGORY:Education 

CONTENT:  ['Toby Young has resigned from the board of a new university regulator after criticism over controversial comments.Writing for , Mr Young said his appointment had "become a distraction" from the "vital work" of the Office for Students. The right-wing journalist unreservedly apologised for past comments he said were "ill-judged or just plain wrong". The OfS chairman said Mr Young was "right" to quit and his remarks were "not in line" with the body\'s values.Sir Michael Barber said he had done some "good work" in education and to promote greater social mobility.But he added: "Many of his previous tweets and articles were offensive... he was correct to say that his continuation in the role would have distracted from our important work."The Department for Education said it remains confident the OfS, the regulator for England\'s higher education sector, will deliver for students.A petition calling for Mr Young\'s dismissal had gathered almost 220,000 signatures. He faced a backlash after his appointment was announced, with critics attacking his suitability for the role.The columnist co-founded the West London Free School - which opened in 2011 - and runs the New Schools Network. The charity promotes free schools in England - of which . Following his appointment to the OfS, Mr Young deleted up to 40,000 tweets posted since 2009, including references to the size of women\'s breasts.Comments made about working class students, about "inclusivity" in a , and remarks aimed at gay people, were also criticised. Toby Young started out as a journalist founding the culture magazine Modern Review with Julie Burchill.Following the collapse of the magazine he was recruited to work on Vanity Fair in New York, an experience that inspired his book "How to Lose Friends and Alienate People".As a Spectator columnist, Mr Young made a number of controversial comments including a description of wheelchair ramps as part of "ghastly" inclusivity in schools.In 2011 he set up the West London Free School which placed importance on discipline, ambition and "a competitive atmosphere". After resigning from his position as CEO of the West London Free School Trust, he said he hadn\'t "grasped how difficult it is to do better" and that he regretted his earlier criticism of teachers. His experience with schools led to his appointment to the Office for Students regulator - a move critics argued he was neither suitable nor had the right expertise for.Chair of the Commons education committee Robert Halfon said remarks Mr Young had made on disability, eugenics and working people went too far."If we are to stand up as the Conservative party for what is right," he told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme, "we also have to accept when we have made a mistake".  Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of Buckingham University, said it was "utterly unacceptable" to have such a person on a public body, involved with education.In his resignation article, Mr Young said "the caricature" drawn of him during the past week was "unrecognisable".He wrote: "I am a passionate supporter of inclusion and helping the most disadvantaged, as I hope my track record of setting up and supporting new schools demonstrates. "But some of the things I said before I got involved in education, when I was a journalistic provocateur, were either ill-judged or just plain wrong - and I unreservedly apologise."Mr Young thanked Prime Minister Theresa May and the former education secretary Justine Greening for their support.Mrs May has said she was "" by his previous remarks.Toby Young wasn\'t appointed directly by the prime minister, but the pressure was on her to sack him when the details of his previous remarks emerged. Her decision to defend his position - while criticising his past comments - allowed opponents to once again question her judgement and authority. Mrs May\'s supporters have pointed to Mr Young\'s achievements in the field of education and said his resignation was a matter for him. It\'s unlikely it will have huge or lasting consequences for the prime minister, but just two days into Westminster\'s new year it\'s an unwelcome distraction from the authoritative image Mrs May wants to portray, and it adds to the overall perception of a government where things don\'t tend to run too smoothly.The Office for Students has been established to hold universities to account on issues like vice chancellors\' pay and free speech on campus. It has powers to fine universities which fail to meet the required standards.Toby Young\'s track record setting up & supporting free schools speaks for itself. His decision to stand down from the OfS board and repeat unreserved apologies for inappropriate past remarks reflects his character better than the one-sided caricature from his armchair critics.End of Twitter post  by @JoJohnsonUKThe Toby Young saga has cast great doubt on the judgment of the PM who failed to sack him in the first place.

CONTENT:  ['A project to get more disadvantaged youngsters in the UK to apply to leading universities is being applied to schools in South Africa\'s townships.The  is an award-winning scheme that puts PhD students into schools in the UK, with the aim of teaching new skills, raising aspirations and making university seem a more attainable goal.In South Africa, operating as AccessEd, it has completed a pilot year in 16 schools and two youth centres, with pupils aged about 13 to 15.In the UK, the big divide in access to university is social background. Young people from wealthy families are much more likely to go to university than poorer youngsters.This is also the case in South Africa - but with the big overlaying factor of race casting a post-apartheid shadow.The university access rate for white teenagers is over 40%, for their black counterparts it is below 10%.Programme director Rajbir Hazelwood says that as well as academic challenges, there are some big practical difficulties to overcome.In townships such as Philippi in Cape Town and Alexandra in Johannesburg, the problems can be about the lack of basic infrastructure and "classrooms fit for purpose". In Philippi, she says: "The majority of our pupils had no access to ICT [information and communications technology]."With basic needs not met, these under-resourced schools face an upward struggle in supporting their pupils in the matriculation exams which allow you to go to university in South Africa." Ms Hazelwood adds that university dropout rates are very high in South Africa, as much as 40%.While the focus of the project in the UK is giving young people the confidence to apply, in South Africa they have to give their students the "academic and social skills" needed to complete their degrees.But in both the UK and in South Africa, a key part of this project has been to give disadvantaged youngsters a sense of intellectual challenge, inspiring them to think beyond their immediate horizons.The postgraduate students working with the project run tutorials and teach university-style courses, with assignments and marking.In South Africa, for those who successfully finish the programme, the graduation event is to go to a university and  see, perhaps for the first time, what it\'s like to be a student and to show that it\'s an accessible target.It\'s a chance for the university too to talk to young people about how they might take the next steps and what they will need to get on to a degree course.University access in South Africa is also highly political, with protests that poor, black youngsters are still not getting their fair chances, either through cost or inadequacies in their school-level education.Last month, responding to such dissatisfaction, the president, Jacob Zuma, promised free higher education for poorer students, with grants covering fees to be phased in from this year.But this has raised questions about whether the university system has the capacity for many more students and how this will be delivered.Although continents apart, the projects in the UK and South Africa both reflect the significance of getting young people into university."Graduates have better employment prospects and earning power, better health and wellbeing and better civic engagement," says the impact report on AccessEd\'s pilot phase.But access to becoming a graduate remains deeply unequal.More from Ideas for the ?

CONTENT:  ['Damian Hinds has become the new Education Secretary, replacing Justine Greening. What are the questions waiting at the top of his in-tray? And what should he do differently to avoid the sudden exit of his predecessor?Damian Hinds will have to re-energise the Conservatives\' vision for education, finding something positive that will connect with the public.From the perspective of 10 Downing Street, it must have seemed as though Labour was making much of the weather over schools and universities. Parents were worried about being asked to bail out cash-starved schools. And Jeremy Corbyn\'s promise to scrap tuition fees had seen Labour\'s student vote reaching record levels. Justine Greening seemed unenthusiastic about the prime minister\'s Tory heartlands view of education, characterised by the push for more grammar schools. But, it is suggested, there was impatience in Downing Street about the lack of any clear alternative vision or policy offer for parents.There is a catch for Mr Hinds. His revival has to cost nothing and not take up legislative time consumed by Brexit.Theresa May has promised a major review of university funding and how much students should be expected to pay - as evidence that she was "listening" after the election.Jo Johnson, the outgoing Universities Minister, had made no secret of his reluctance for any significant changes. But his departure opens the way for a much more far-reaching review. The rising levels of fees, interest charges and student debt, have been like a recurrent political toothache, and Mr Hinds will be looking for an affordable way to neutralise the electoral pain.It\'s been the mouse-trap hidden in the in-tray for ministers of successive governments.And he will have to see whether university bosses can really be more restrained over pay, after the chastening battles over "fat cat" salaries.School funding gaps and teacher shortages are among the issues that heads see as most urgent. They are exasperated that they have to keep juggling and struggling on with what they claim are inadequate budgets.In the election it became a significant doorstep issue, not least because head teachers discovered the power of sending a letter home to millions of parents.When it comes to plausibility, head teachers\' warnings of cuts to children\'s lessons will always win out over politicians protesting that funding is at record levels.It\'s a challenge that the new education secretary will have to resolve. Otherwise he risks cold water being poured over any other initiatives, as heads tell ministers to get back to the basics of funding and staffing.Damian Hinds and Justine Greening have something in common. They both say social mobility is a priority, as has the prime minister. But what does it really mean? The government\'s own social mobility commissioners walked out claiming so far it had been all talk and no progress.Mr Hinds has previously highlighted the importance of investing in the early years, before the social divide begins to widen. He has also pointed to the central importance of high-quality teachers to making sure that the disadvantaged get the best chances in school.It might seem an age ago, but before the election the focus of social mobility was on the need to help "ordinary working families", working hard on low incomes and without access to good schools.Mr Hinds will have to decide how to make social mobility something more than rhetoric and good intentions.As a former grammar school boy from the north-west of England, with a Hampshire constituency, Mr Hinds will be seen as representing a less metropolitan view of education.He will be seen as closer to the views of Tory backbenchers, uncertain about the wholesale ditching of grammar schools.Mr Hinds will also be expected to push through a change to free school regulations, promised in the Conservative manifesto, which would make it easier for faith groups to set up new schools.This would allow religious free schools to give priority in admissions in the same way as existing local authority and academy faith schools.Such a change, likely to increase the number of faith schools, will be opposed by humanists and secular campaigners.But that could be the kind of opposition and clear blue water that would be relished by an education secretary wanting to assert his traditionalist credentials.Ministers have always been advised to pick their enemies as carefully as their friends - and Mr Hinds will also have noted that Ms Greening\'s bridge-building with the teachers\' unions did her no political favours.And someone somewhere is going to write a headline about the benefit of "Hinds-sight".']	 CATEGORY:Education 

CONTENT:  ['Singing could help mothers recover from post-natal depression more quickly, a study suggests. Researchers found that women who took part in group singing sessions with their babies experienced a much faster improvement in their symptoms than those who did not.The study, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, looked at 134 mothers with post-natal depression. Early recovery is seen to be crucial to limit effects on mother and baby.Post-natal depression is estimated to affect one in eight new mothers. Previous studies have indicated singing can help improve the mental health of older people and those with dementia, but this is the first controlled study of its effect on post-natal depression. The women were placed into three groups:The singing workshops saw the mothers learning lullabies and songs from around the world with their babies and creating new songs together about motherhood. And those with moderate to severe symptoms of post-natal depression reported a much faster improvement than mothers in the usual care and play groups.All the groups improved over the 10 weeks, but in the first six weeks the singing group had already reported an average 35% decrease in depressive symptoms. Principal investigator Dr Rosie Perkins said the study, although small, was significant because it was important to tackle the symptoms as quickly as possible. "Post-natal depression is debilitating for mothers and their families, yet our research indicates that for some women something as accessible as singing with their baby could help to speed up recovery at one of the most vulnerable times of their lives," she said.  Lead author Dr Daisy Fancourt, from University College London, said singing was another useful therapy to offer women."Many mothers have concerns about taking depression medication whilst breast-feeding and uptake of psychological therapies with new mothers is relatively low," she said."So these results are really exciting as they suggest that something as simple as referring mothers to community activities could support their recovery."  Dr Trudi Seneviratne, who chairs the Royal College of Psychiatrists\' Perinatal Faculty, said: "It\'s exciting to hear about the growing evidence base for novel psychosocial interventions such as singing to facilitate a more rapid recovery for women with post-natal depression. "I look forward to more work in this area in the future, as it will be enjoyed by both mothers and their babies."Since the study, Breathe Arts Health Research has started running singing workshops in partnership with Guy\'s and St Thomas\' NHS Foundation Trust for women with post-natal depression across the south London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark.

CONTENT:  ['For most of us, January is the month you can finally relax.Christmas is done and dusted, New Year is out of the way, and you can watch half your friends attempt regimes with names like Dry Veganuary.But if you\'re a menswear fashion designer, it\'s a different story.While most of us have been in a post-Christmas stupor, they have been busy finalising their latest creations after months of painstaking work in preparation for London Fashion Week Men\'s (LFWM), which returned this weekend.The event was established in 2012 and now runs twice a year, a month ahead of the main Fashion Weeks.And few catwalk shows attract as much attention as Craig Green\'s.The 31-year-old, who has been  British Menswear Designer of the Year for the last two years in a row, premieres his latest collection on Monday - the last day of LFWM.Sitting down with BBC News just before Christmas, Green seems remarkably chilled out - but a great deal of work has gone into his latest collection."It\'s a very long process," he says. "Because the shows are six months apart, we start planning a month after the last show."But it\'s continuously changing, we order fabrics, we get things back that we think are going to be great, and then we see them, we\'re cutting them up, changing them, developing them in the studio."It\'s a five-month process, and we work long hours!"But, judging by the press Green has received in recent fashion weeks, the work is paying off. described his shows as "a highlight of the London menswear schedule", while  Luke Day recently said: "It\'s the quiet confidence of his work that defines him as the most exciting new menswear designer of our time." For someone who only set up his own label in 2012, shortly after graduating from Central Saint Martins college, Craig\'s star has risen rapidly.He was enlisted to design costumes for 2015\'s Alien: Covenant, and his creations have been worn by the likes of , Jay-Z and ."We were asked to create something custom for the opening look of Rihanna\'s tour," Green explains."But someone like Jay-Z, he just bought that T-shirt, so we didn\'t know about that until we saw it. Sometimes they just go into a store and buy it."Big names aside, Green says his biggest thrill often comes from seeing people in the street wearing his clothes."I remember after the first collection, I was walking past Liberty\'s and I saw someone wearing one of our knitted hats, and I didn\'t know them, they weren\'t a friend or fashion journalist, and I remember how weird it was. "And to realise that that person made a conscious choice to go into a shop and buy it, that\'s very strange in the beginning, but also exciting."Green\'s success and critical acclaim are particularly notable for the fact he "didn\'t come from an art or fashion-based family"."I come from north-west London, and my dad is a plumber and my mum was a nurse," he says. "Art was just the subject that I seemed to do well in at school."After a friend recommended going to an open day at Central Saint Martins, which Green hadn\'t heard of at the time, he ended up securing a place to study art.Green initially had the idea of being a portrait painter or sculptor, but ended up being most taken with fashion - enjoying the community feel of the course, the pace of the work and the ability to experiment.In the beginning, "I made a few really bad dresses for a charity fashion show", he laughs. "I didn\'t know how to sew - they were pretty much stapled together I think."But he soon discovered his passion for menswear. A post shared by  (@craig__green) on End of Instagram post  by craig__green"My designs always play on ideas of function, things that used to be functional or things that look like they do something but they don\'t. "Excessive numbers of pockets, strings that pull in your waist, or strings look like if you pulled them maybe would inflate - it\'s that play on functionality. It\'s about looking at things that aren\'t initially romantic and finding something interesting or beautiful in them. "And I don\'t know why, but we always go back to ideas of uniform or having lots of guys wearing the same kind of thing."It might just be because people don\'t really wear uniforms any more, and I think there\'s something romantic about having a communal way of dress, or that one size fits all utilitarian workwear feeling."Green remembers one particular fashion show that inspired him to get into the industry."I went to a show when I was in college and it was so thrilling and exciting and it had so much energy, people were pushing to get in, people were jumping over barriers, there was so much energy in the room," he says."And really, a fashion show is just people walking up and down with music on for a few minutes. But I was so surprised that you could make someone feel something or have so much excitement with just clothes, models and music. "So when we approach a show, it\'s almost like it\'s meant to be a kind of exciting or creative fantasy version of what\'s available to sell. We don\'t sell the pieces with wooden elements, for example, but a lot of those more extreme kind of sculpture pieces end up as part of museum collections. "We make those pieces because it\'s about creating a world or a strong visual, but then we also sell jackets and shirts and things that are more accessible for people."Of course, one of the main issues the public can have with designer labels is pricing. Why spend more money on a jacket with a particular label when you can get it cheaper elsewhere?But, Green explains: "The way things are priced are directly relative to the cost. So if you\'re making a smaller number of things in an Italian factory, it\'s a different price to making things en masse. "And usually we choose high quality fabrics, it\'s the technique, the complicated aspects of the construction. There\'s a whole pricing structure, and then in the store they buy wholesale so they add their percentage on."That attention to quality and detail seems to have paid off for Green so far.The fashion industry will be watching with interest as he unveils his new collection Monday to find out where he might go next.']	 CATEGORY:Entertainment

CONTENT:  ['French actress Catherine Deneuve has said that men should be "free to hit on" women.She is one of 100 French women who wrote an open letter, warning about a new "puritanism" sparked by recent sexual harassment scandals.It deplores a wave of "denunciations", following rape allegations made against US movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. A group of French feminists condemned the letter, accusing the signatories of trivialising sexual violence.Mr Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex, but has admitted that his behaviour has "caused a lot of pain".The letter by French women writers, performers and academics was published in France\'s Le Monde newspaper on Tuesday."Men have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone\'s knee or try to steal a kiss," it said."Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not - and nor is men being gentlemanly a chauvinist attack."The authors argued that there was a new "puritanism" afoot in the world.They said that while it was legitimate and necessary to speak out against the abuse of power by some men, the constant denunciations have spiralled out of control.According to the writers, this is creating a public mood in which women are seen as powerless, as perpetual victims. "As women we do not recognise ourselves in this feminism, which beyond denouncing the abuse of power, takes on a hatred of men and of sexuality."Deneuve is by far the most prominent of them.The other 99 women who signed the document include some well-known figures, such as actress Christine Boisson; conservative journalist Élisabeth Lévy; Brigitte Lahaie, a 1970s porn star who is now a talk-show host; Catherine Millet, a writer and magazine editor.There are also lesser-known names from the worlds of entertainment, the arts, the media, and academia. Most of the signatories, however, are professionals who are not known to the French public.The letter has stirred debate in France. On Wednesday a group of about 30 feminists issued a statement accusing Deneuve and her co-signatories of seeking to "close the lid" on the scandals uncovered by the Weinstein case, and of "pouring scorn" on victims of sexual violence.On social media, many expressed either anger or sadness at the open letter. , saying they had "failed to agree". The backlash against the letter, however, has not been front-page news and is not trending on Twitter in France. The reason may be that controversy over exposing sex pests has been rumbling on for several months now in France.The debate has mostly pitted those belonging to the older generation, who view #Metoo and similar campaigns as a threat to the sexual liberation achieved in the 1960s, against younger, activist types who feel that the battle against harassment is the latest stage in the fight for women\'s rights.She is not known as an activist star.  However, last year the 74-year-old spoke out against social media campaigns shaming men accused of harassing women.Women and men from all over the globe who have been sexually harassed have been sharing their stories across social media using the hashtag #MeToo. In France, Twitter users are using #Balancetonporc  ("rat on your dirty old man") to encourage women to name and shame their attackers.Ms Deneuve, an Oscar-nominated actress, has been in more than 100 films, making her debut in 1957.']	 CATEGORY:Entertainment

Radiohead rejected her offer of 40% of the song\'s publishing royalties, she claimed, demanding 100% percent."Their lawyers have been relentless," she added, "so we will deal with it in court."It’s true about the lawsuit. Although I know my song wasn’t inspired by Creep, Radiohead feel it was and want 100% of the publishing - I offered up to 40 over the last few months but they will only accept 100. Their lawyers have been relentless, so we will deal with it in court.End of Twitter post  by @LanaDelReyRadiohead\'s publisher, Warner/Chappell, has since issued a statement clarifying its position. "It\'s true that we\'ve been in discussions since August of last year with Lana Del Rey\'s representatives," it said. "It\'s clear that the verses of Get Free use musical elements found in the verses of Creep and we\'ve requested that this be acknowledged in favour of all writers of Creep. "To set the record straight, no lawsuit has been issued and Radiohead have not said they \'will only accept 100%\' of the publishing of Get Free."Radiohead themselves were successfully sued by over Creep\'s similarities to The Air That I Breathe - which was made famous by The Hollies.Ultimately, the case was settled and Albert Hammond and Mike Hazlewood are now listed as co-writers for the song.']	 CATEGORY:Entertainment

She took the tweet down, I don\'t know, I can\'t speak for her," he continued."The others, look, in my life I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I\'ve done. I have to do that to maintain my wellbeing."I do it whenever I know that there is something wrong or needs to be changed. I make it a point to do it."The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn\'t have a voice for so long."So, I don\'t want to shut them down in anyway. It\'s, I think, a good thing and I support it."Franco and his brother Dave had been due to appear at a New York Times-sponsored event in New York on Wednesday to discuss The Disaster Artist.In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, a spokesperson for the newspaper said it was "no longer comfortable proceeding... given the controversy surrounding recent allegations".Franco won the Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy or musical for his role in The Disaster Artist, which details the making of notorious 2003 film The Room.This year\'s ceremony saw several winners address Hollywood\'s sexual abuse scandal in their acceptance speeches.Many attendees, meanwhile, opted to wear black to express solidarity with victims of sexual abuse and harassment.']	 CATEGORY:Entertainment

"Sadly that\'s not to be."Richard Fleeshman, Frances McNamee and Emmerdale\'s Charlie Hardwick will play other lead roles in the show, which has its UK premiere at Northern Stage on 12 March.The show\'s producer Karl Sydow said: "After protracted negotiations carried out in good faith, we regret to announce the production\'s offer of employment to Jimmy Nail has been withdrawn."All at The Last Ship thank him for his generosity and enormous contribution during what has been an eight-year journey."Nail, who played Leonard "Oz" Osborne in 1980s comedy-drama Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, first portrayed Jackie when The Last Ship had a pre-Broadway try-out in Chicago in 2014.He was replaced by Sting himself during the show\'s Broadway run in an attempt to boost ticket sales.Sting created The Last Ship as a tribute to the shipbuilding community in his home town of Wallsend.The musical tells of a group of unemployed shipbuilders who take over a closed factory to build one final ship."To anyone who has purchased a ticket, please go see the show and give this vessel the launch it so deserves," Nail\'s statement continued."You\'ll hear some of the finest musical works ever composed for the stage."After Newcastle, The Last Ship will tour to Liverpool, Northampton, Leeds, Nottingham, Birmingham and Cardiff.It will then make visits to Dublin, Edinburgh, Glasgow and York before ending its tour at The Lowry in Salford in early July.']	 CATEGORY:Entertainment

He has led the RPO since 2009. Retired opera singer Paula Rasmussen claimed he accosted her in his dressing room, while another singer, Sylvia McNair, alleged he had "tried to have his way" with her in 1985.Two other accusers who asked to remain anonymous made similar allegations to the Associated Press news agency.In a statement, Dutoit said the "serious" accusations "involving coercion and forced physical contact" had "absolutely no basis in truth".He said: "The allegations made against me are as shocking to me as they are to my friends and colleagues.

CONTENT:  ["IAMDDB, a Manchester vocalist whose music is full of fearless attitude and sensual soul, is at number three on the BBC's Sound of 2018 list.IAMDDB comes across as a fully-formed superstar who's waiting to step out of the shadows.Her sound, which melts together neo-soul, urban jazz, hip-hop and R&B, is by turns sharp and seductive. That, and her stylistic vision, are astonishingly assured for an artist who only started making waves six months ago.Her vocal and production talent are fuelled by a fierce independence and a single-minded determination that nothing is going to stand in her way.She dropped her first track in September 2016 - the same day she quit university, just an hour after enrolling.The singer was inspired to pursue her musical and artistic ambition after a trip to Angola, where her father is in one of the country's most popular bands.Before her African trip, she did make her inroads into music under her real name Diana DeBrito (such as  inspired by ). She was far from fully formed then. Now, she's ready to go.DDB just stands for my initials - Diana DeBrito. I've been doing a lot of soul-searching for a while now and I thought the best way to connect with people is to show that it's cool being yourself, and I just thought I am DDB. Keep it simple. That's who I am. I started writing at a very young age - about seven or eight. I recorded my first track at 11 at my dad's studio. I made £50. I was buzzing. An 11-year-old with £50! I thought I'd won the lottery.Around high school time, and I did music at college. But when I went to Africa, that's when I started really understanding, OK, music is actually what I want to do. I started producing, engineering, learning the in-betweens of music, not just lyricism and the beat.Writing's always been second nature - I can write anywhere, under any circumstance. Anything can inspire me. It feels very natural to write.Every woman at one point in life experiences a bad relationship and I just needed different energies and different surroundings - almost a reset button to my whole existence. So I thought, I'll go to Africa, experience something completely new.We ended up going for six months and toured here and there. Did a whole heap of jazz. It was amazing. And it really inspired me. I thought, if I can do this in Africa, surely I can do something back home.He is. He's based in Angola and he's in a band out there - Afro soul, Afro jazz - and I thought what better way to overcome the personal issues I'm going through than to connect with music with different people?It was a very big culture shock but that whole trip taught me so much about myself, about us as humans, poverty, luxury - it was sick. I advise everybody: You must go to Africa at least once in your life.Definitely - that was the moment I realised, OK Dee, you want to make music? Cool, well, the world is your oyster, go out there and make music.I came back, tried to do education. I went to uni for one hour. I thought, nope, this isn't for me. The same day I started and quit uni was the same day I dropped .Bob Marley was my number one inspiration. I grew up listening to Bob Marley in the car, in the studio, in the house. Everywhere we went, Bob Marley was always playing. The way I write, the way I harmonise, everything is essentially inspired by Bob Marley.Apart from him, there's a lady called Gretchen Parlato - she's top notch. People like Jordan Rakei, Tom Misch, they've inspired me on this journey.A South African musician as well, Jimmy Dludlu - that's when I got into Afro soul and Afro jazz. Sick musician. Please check him out.My dad was the biggest inspiration. Watching him do it inspired me and made me think, yeah, I want to do that exact same thing. He's supported me through every decision I've made in life. Bless my mum as well - she's supported me through everything.End of Youtube post  by iamddbVEVOJust accepting where I've come from and where I am in this state of mind and all these transitions that I'm going through, I feel like I've embraced that inner shyness and it's slowly going away and becoming this little woman that's got confidence.It's such a blessing to be able to evolve and grow, doing what I love to do. One thousand million per cent. So important. Top of the list. I made sure I signed myself to myself to ensure no BS was going to be involved.I made a promise to myself that if I was to do it, it would have to be 100% my way. We all know if you sign to labels, etc, you're going to have to compromise somewhere down the line, and DDB don't do compromising, I promise you, girl!I believe in myself enough to not let anybody take control of what I do with my art. I'm always up for taking criticism that can improve it, but with regards to creative control, I feel like that's so essential for any artist to have.For me, music is my therapy. That's where I express myself. That's why I'm so honest with it. I speak about personal issues. I speak about other people's experiences. Anything I make, I own. It's so much fun because no matter what decision I make, whether it's right or wrong, it's made by me, and it's my career, so why not? It's my way or no way.entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."]	 CATEGORY:Entertainment

I am on [social media], and I have a constant inner battle about it."I\'m not on Twitter, I don\'t want to always have something to say, I want to save that for my life."Also I think, especially as a young person, you change your opinions every second, so [you shouldn\'t] put something down in concrete that\'s going to come back and haunt you."That certainly explains her absence from Twitter - but there\'s no doubt Lily\'s Instagram game is strong. A post shared by @ on End of Instagram post  by lilyjamesofficial"Instagram you can use for all sorts of different reasons and that can be powerful. But I do worry about obsession and about perfection and about always presenting your life in a certain way, which is very untrue to how you go about your day."We go through all sorts of different emotions and Instagram makes it look like everything\'s perfect, and that\'s rubbish."Lily plays Winston Churchill\'s secretary Elizabeth Leyton in Darkest Hour, which is released in UK cinemas this weekend.On Tuesday, it was  for nine awards at this year\'s Baftas - including best actor for Gary Oldman, who stars as Winston Churchill. He won the same accolade at this year\'s .Darkest Hour is Lily\'s first major film appearance since Baby Driver last summer, in which she co-starred with Kevin Spacey, although they had few scenes together.Given the string of , and other major Hollywood figures, is she glad the issue is being talked about in Hollywood?"Yes, completely. I think the bravery of everyone that\'s come forward and spoken, the fact that they\'ve shared their pain and their stories in order to make change is the most admirable brilliant thing. "And I\'m so hopeful that now there\'s going to be a huge shift in how that power balance has been and how people have been treated."The actress adds that she agrees with  that there may have been less abuse in the entertainment industry had there been more women in positions of power."There\'d be less room for it," Lily says. "I\'m lucky enough to have just made a film [Little Woods, released later this year] with a young female director, the producers were women and the story was about women, and it was such a change. I hadn\'t experienced that before. "That needs to become the norm, commonplace, I want to work with female directors as much as I do male directors, I want to look around the crew and not be surrounded by men, so that will be something that hopefully is changing, and I\'m so inspired by all these people that are making their voices heard."Darkest Hour focuses on Churchill\'s first month in power - in which he struggles with whether or not to attempt to negotiate a peace deal with Nazi Germany.The World War II drama probably isn\'t the sort of film Lily\'s young fans would normally have much interest in, certainly not to the same degree as many of her previous movies like Cinderella.But the 28-year-old thinks it\'s important the film reaches a young audience, "for all sorts of reasons"."We can learn so much from our history," she says."Especially at the moment. When you watch a film about a very powerful leader at the time where he really was the voice and will of the people and united the country."I don\'t think there\'s necessarily that kind of strength in leaders at the moment, so I think it\'s quite inspiring."Lily\'s next role is ever-so-slightly different to Darkest Hour - Mamma Mia 2: Here We Go Again, which is released in the summer."All I can really say is I had one of the greatest experiences of my life," Lily says of filming the sequel to the hugely successful Abba musical."To work on both Mamma Mia and Darkest Hour, given how different they are... with Mamma Mia all the old cast are back, so I\'m working with actors who are Oscar winners, it\'s sort of mind-blowing and I\'m very excited and grateful about that. "The music is wonderful, there are new songs which are going to be huge hits, and there are old songs which are back again," she adds.

He said a former employee was accusing him of performing a sex act in front of her more than 30 years ago.: "This is a complete lie, fabrication, no truth to it whatsoever."He said his lawyer contacted him in December, telling him a media outlet was planning to run a story about the woman\'s claims. Douglas said the woman was also alleging he "blackballed" her so she couldn\'t get another job after he fired her, that he used "colourful language" in front of her and "spoke raunchily" in private conversations with his friends on the phone."It\'s extremely painful," said Douglas, describing the situation as a "nightmare". "I pride myself on my reputation in this business, not to mention the long history of my father and everything else. I don\'t have skeletons in my closet, or anyone else who\'s coming out or saying this. I\'m bewildered why, after 32 years, this is coming out, now."He said he "had the choice of waiting for a story to come out" and trying to defend himself, or to "share with the public, a little ahead of the story, my thoughts and concerns".The woman is a writer but hasn\'t been identified. Douglas told Deadline: "I\'ve worked with women my entire life. It has never been an issue."He said there was no evidence against him, adding: "I can only imagine this has come up to hurt someone, or to benefit someone in a book deal so they can write a chapter on me."He added: "I support the #metoo movement with all my heart. I have always supported women, along the way." But he warned: "This is the kind of step that can set that movement back."Being accused, without a chance [to defend yourself] in court. To not even really have the information in front of you, to be able to argue or defend yourself. There is no due process, no chance of seeing evidence in front of me from my accuser. It worries me."He said he had the support of his family and the film studios he\'s currently working with, but admitted he was "fearful". "I\'m hurt, really hurt and offended and I wonder if people realise when you do something like this, it hurts a lot more than just one person," he added.

I don\'t know how the song would go - but I just know my mom has an amazing and beautiful voice.The form of expression. Just how a three-minute song can make you feel so many different things. I remember the first time I was ever part of a musical [] seeing the reactions from the crowd, and seeing how sad they got, but then how happy they got - that\'s something I wanted to be a part of. But I was a little bit too nervous to write music myself.I feel like the amount of vulnerability that I had to put myself through when I wrote my first song. I wasn\'t ready to be so emotional out loud, because I felt like nobody cared, or nobody wanted to listen. But at the end of the day, I took a step back and I\'m like, "OK, well how much do I care about myself and my own mental health?" and that\'s when I wrote my first song.Oh, definitely. It was for myself first. What I didn\'t realise at the time, is there are so many teenagers going through the same type of situations as I was going through. We\'re all finding out so much about ourselves, we\'re growing up. Mellow. Chill. Not too much, not too little. Kind of soulful, very moody. Emotional but still kind of gets you up off of your feet!Ooooh…. One lyric? Honestly, if I could summarise my teenage life, I couldn\'t put it in one lyric but I could put it on a song - Young Dumb & Broke.I had faith - because, after I recorded that song, I got back to my apartment and I danced in the mirror for 10 minutes. Non-stop. I feel like I\'m just so young. Way too young to be committed to anything. My personality is like, I\'m so spontaneous. I\'m that friend who will call you last minute and be like, \'Hey, let\'s drive to Disneyland right now!\' And they\'ll be like, \'Disneyland is two hours away\' and I\'m like, \'I know! Let\'s just do it!\'Honestly, I just went to Universal Studios in LA and my favourite ride had to be the Harry Potter ride. But the thing is, it got stuck mid-way through! We were just hanging in mid-air for, like, eight minutes.Right! There must be some mojo involving me that made that ride stop!That could never be me. I would cry.End of Youtube post  by marshmelloWhen I teamed up with [dance producer] Marshmello, I knew I wanted to be vulnerable - and so, when I wrote this song, it was very personal and it was very deep and I was very upset. But the moment the song came out, I went to Australia and I saw fans screaming every single word, every night. To have that in a whole different continent? It was awesome. I keep all of my exes\' numbers saved, just in case they feel like they need to talk to me, or I need to talk to them - because they all started as friends first. Even if we\'re not as close as we were after the end of the relationship, I have so much love for all of them.All the time. All the time. And I\'m a person who stands my ground. I let them know. I had a lot of great friends and then I had a lot of friends who couldn\'t deal with the things I was going through. They didn\'t want to deal through all that, but then they wanted to celebrate me when I became successful, and I don\'t feel like that\'s fair.It\'s insane. I just can\'t believe it. It happened way faster than I thought it would. I remember talking to people and I\'d be like, "maybe I\'ll get nominated for something in 2019" but it was way faster! It was something I couldn\'t have prepared for but I\'m just so blessed.Best new artist. Hands down.It\'s amazing competition because they are extraordinary artists, every one. It\'s crazy because a lot of them inspired me - so to be up against my inspirations is slightly overwhelming, but it\'s definitely exciting.Music is in such an interesting place right now. You can look like anything. You can be anybody and you can still be super-successful because the listeners are looking for relationships. They\'re looking for people they can look up to. The fact that I am nominated, I\'m 19 years old, I\'m this boy from El Paso Texas, and so many people across the world sing my songs? It\'s crazy on its own. Oh yeah! One of my good friends  is on the longlist as well. I love her so much. Her star is going to shine so bright. Oh, that\'s my favourite song.Ooh, yes. I\'ve been in the studio a lot and there are a lot of collaborations to look forward to. I mean, I\'m excited to work on my own but the collabs... I\'ve been listening to them on repeat. They\'re awesome.Persistence is key. Don\'t listen to negativity. There\'s so much hate in the world because people are envious, so focus on yourself. Don\'t give up. And always be you. That\'s my advice. Peace out.']	 CATEGORY:Entertainment 

CONTENT:  ['Jo Whiley is to co-present a new, extended drivetime show with Simon Mayo, as Radio 2 overhauls its schedule.Whiley will be the first female DJ on the station\'s weekday daytime schedule for 20 years. Debbie Thrower was the last, presenting Radio 2\'s afternoon show between 1995 and 1998.At a time when pay equality is under scrutiny at the BBC, Radio 2 confirmed Mayo and Whiley will earn the same.In other changes to the station\'s line-up, Sara Cox will present a new show from 22:00 to midnight every Monday to Thursday.  Gary Davies replaces Cox on the popular Sound of the 80s programme while 6 Music\'s Cerys Matthews takes over the Blues Show from Paul Jones, who leaves the station after more than 30 years.The Arts Show will be ending, as will The Organist Entertains - which has been on the network for almost 50 years.Presenter Nigel Ogden thanked listeners for supporting the show over the last five decades."I\'ve loved hearing from them and send them my very best wishes for the future. I\'d also like to thank Radio 2 for giving me the opportunity to play the music I love each week. It has been a huge privilege." Listen to the Band is also being taken off the air. Radio 2 says brass band music will continue to be played elsewhere.The changes, which come into effect from 14 May, also see Robot Wars presenter Angela Scanlon added to the Sunday morning schedule, and OJ Borg presenting a live overnight show on weekdays.Whiley, who joined Radio 2 in 2011, currently hosts a weeknight show specialising in new music. She started her career as a researcher on Channel 4\'s The Word and hosted Radio 1\'s Evening Session with Steve Lamacq at the height of Britpop.The new drivetime show is the first time she has shared the microphone with Mayo. "Although we\'ve known each other for over 20 years, we\'ve never presented a show together," said Mayo in a statement. "And given that Jo is quite brilliant, it\'s high time we put that right." "What a thrill to be working with Simon on this exciting new show," added Whiley.  "It\'s going to be great fun and listeners can look forward to some incredible music and chat, as well as being introduced to some fantastic new talent along the way. Cannot wait! "Their pairing results in an extra hour of radio, with the drivetime slot extended from 17:00 to 20:00 every weekday, except Friday - when Tony Blackburn\'s Golden Hour remains from 19:00 to 20:00. As a result, the weekly Blues, Jazz, Folk and Country shows will move one hour later - starting at 20:00 from Monday to Thursday.According to figures published by the BBC last July, Mayo currently receives a salary in the range £350,000 - £399,999, while Whiley is paid £150,000 - £199,999.Although they will receive equal pay for their upcoming show, there will still be a disparity in their total salaries, as Mayo presents a weekly show for 5 Live, and Whiley hosts events including Glastonbury for BBC television.

CONTENT:  ['Glamorgan pair Prem Sisodiya and Roman Walker have arrived in New Zealand as they try to make an impression in the England under-19 cricket side in the World Cup.It is the first time Glamorgan Cricket Club has had two players in the England age-group side in more than a decade."It\'s a different experience with the intensity, it\'ll be nice to represent Glamorgan and Wales," said Sisodiya. Both made their debuts in a warm-up tournament in South Africa in December.Sisodiya, a spinner who plays for Cardiff CC, made a spectacular debut, hitting 63 and taking four wickets in a win over Namibia."I wasn\'t expecting it but it was nice to get a few runs and wickets in the first game, then a couple of wickets against South Africa," he told BBC Sport Wales. "I just want to contribute to the team in whatever role I\'m needed to play, it would be nice to go out and score some runs at the end, take some important wickets and keep the run-rate down."Sisodiya, 19, has represented Glamorgan second eleven and sees his inclusion as an important part of his development."It\'s another step on the way (to a professional career), I just need to keep going really," he said of his ambitions.Walker, a 17-year-old opening bowler from Wrexham, has made an unexpectedly early breakthrough to international honours."Twelve months ago I wasn\'t even on the academy with Glamorgan, so it\'s been such a big 12 months I\'m still getting to grips with it," he said."Prem played the year above (his age-group) for Cardiff and Vale and I did for North-East Wales, so I\'ve known him for a long time but I knew no-one else (in the England squad)."England will play Namibia, Bangladesh and Canada in their group in New Zealand, with a strong chance of progressing to the knock-out stages."From what I saw in South Africa we\'ve played pretty well so we should go far", said Walker, who played for Oswestry in the Birmingham League in 2017."My dad Brian took me to a training session at Bersham aged six, I think I just turned my arm over a few times because it was too dangerous for me to bat and I think that\'s how I became a bowler."I went through the junior systems and then went to Marchwiel, I developed there and now I\'m going well at Oswestry."When I came onto the (Glamorgan) academy it cleared my eyes to the fact that I could maybe make something out of it."    The last time Glamorgan had two members of the same England under-19 squad was in 2005-06, when Ben Wright and Mike O\'Shea toured Bangladesh.Seamer James Harris, now with Middlesex, and batsman Aneurin Donald have since been England age-group stars.

At the time that  it felt like the Ashes tour had started to go wrong before England had even picked their squad. And that was just the first bullet that Joe Root's men fired into their collective feet.  and  off the field, opportunities missed and big players missing on it. But to focus solely on the things that England have done wrong and ignoring what Australia have got right, would do the home side a disservice. Here, in a rough reverse order, are the factors I think have led to You can vote which one you think is the main contributor below.The reaction to the announcement of England's squad ranged from bewilderment, through to bemusement and downright anger. The batting looked threadbare, the fast bowling one-paced and the spin-bowling options almost non-existent (and that, remember, was when Stokes was still included). However, the lesser lights and left-field picks have impressed in Australia. Dawid Malan is England's top run-scorer, James Vince and Mark Stoneman have both made two half-centuries and Craig Overton has bowled nicely in his two Tests.  If you offered England the performances that those players have put in, they probably would have taken them.  Yes, the bowling has been exposed (more on that later), but who, realistically, could have made a difference? Mark Wood was injured and Liam Plunkett barely plays first-class cricket.  As Trevor Bayliss has reminded us, you cannot pick what you haven't got. Not nearly as important as was feared. The inexperienced members of England's squad have done as well as could have been expected. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        That England somehow managed to twice find trouble in the same Perth nightclub is barely believable. Jonny Bairstow's 'headbutt' of Cameron Bancroft turned out to be little more than a misunderstanding, yet it still gave ammunition for Australia and left England's players under a curfew. Ben Duckett's drink-pouring over James Anderson was ill-advised, even if it sounded nothing more than team-mates messing around. It still left Bayliss furious, though. Did they really have an effect on results? Yes, Bairstow may have been distracted by an on-field mention of the headbutt, but England were already sliding to defeat in Brisbane.  A distraction, but no real impact on where the urn has ended up. This is not to underplay England's lack of pace, but instead to not overstate the impact of Australia's fast bowlers. At the beginning of the series, much was made of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood playing in a Test together for the first time. In Brisbane, when England's tail was destroyed, it seemed like the trio may combine to inflict some Mitchell Johnson-style damage. But, after that, England got a better grip of Australia's attack. The tail made runs in Adelaide and the tourists came through some fearsome stuff in Perth. Whenever England collapsed, it usually began with a self-inflicted blow. Four years ago, England were blown away. Here, they have been beaten, but not by Australia's pace alone.  Certainly a factor, but not a Johnson-style series-definer. It may well be that this series will be more remembered for what happened outside a Bristol nightclub in the early hours of a September morning than anything that took place on the pitch in Australia. From a cricketing point of view, it is a shame for England and their fans that we will never know how their all-rounder and talisman would have performed in Australia at an age - 26 - where he is in his prime. Not only did England miss his batting, bowling, fielding and up-and-at-em attitude, they were distracted by constant talk of his potential arrival, especially when he travelled to New Zealand. Still, they were heavy underdogs even when Stokes was available and he could have snapped his hamstring in the first warm-up match. One player does not reverse a 3-0 deficit.  Maybe the margin would have be narrower, but it's a stretch to say that Stokes would have won the Ashes for England. For England to have had any chance in this series, their most experienced players needed to navigate Australia with the success of Captain James Cook. Anderson aside, England's big men have flopped. Alastair Cook has managed only 83 runs in six knocks and Root is averaging less than 30. Stuart Broad has taken five wickets at 61.80 apiece, while Moeen Ali's batting average is less than 20 and his bowling average more than 100.     The unknowns have done their bit, it is the stars that have not shone.  Important. How can you win the Ashes if your best players do not perform?Maybe it will take something as seismic as an Ashes defeat for English cricket to confront one of its biggest problems - England do not have the tools to succeed away from home. In the UK, where their skilful, 84mph bowlers swing and seam the ball, England are a fine team, one who have lost a Test series only once since 2012. On foreign soil, where unfamiliar conditions demand extreme pace or mystery spin, England are woeful. It is a problem not restricted to Australia - England have won only one away series in the past five years. Changes to the toss arrangements in the County Championship have been made in a bid to develop different kinds of bowlers, but is that enough? Do workloads, schedules, coaching styles, and attitudes need to be examined? Until England find some variety, they will keep their travel sickness.  A real factor. You can't win Tests without taking 20 wickets. England's bowlers have managed only 35 of the 60 available to them in the series.Big players perform on the big occasions. In this series, Australia captain Steve Smith has proved why he is rated the number one batsman in the world. His unbeaten 141 in the first Test was a match-winning knock, while his double century in the third Test was inevitable, masterful and demoralising to England. There has been a theme. If England cannot get the ball to move, then they are not moving Smith either. Fidgety, unorthodox and run-thirsty, the skipper has been a total irritant to the touring bowlers. You have to go back to Kim Hughes, whose reign ended in 1985, to find the last permanent Australia captain who did not win a home Ashes series.  Smith was determined to join the likes of Allan Border, Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting as Aussie skippers who have stamped their authority on the urn.  In terms of individual players, Smith is the biggest difference between the two sides.England's biggest frustration will be that they have had dominant periods in each of the first three Tests. In Brisbane, they were 127-1 and 246-4 in the first innings before slumping to 302 all out. They let Australia make 328 from 76-4 and 209-7. At the Adelaide Oval, Root opted for first use of the pink ball under a grey sky, only for his bowlers to waste it. After Australia racked up 442-8 declared, England found themselves 142-7 and a strong second half was too little, too late.  Finally, at the Waca, from 368-4 England only managed to get to 403, then saw Australia's batsmen hand out a lesson in ruthlessness by piling on 662-9 declared. When opportunity knocked, England did not answer the door.  Vital. England have competed for long periods in this series, only to fall at crucial moments. Consider this. Australia are just better than England when it comes to playing cricket in Australia. The same works the other way, too. England are unbeaten in home Ashes series since 2001. Australia's home dominance goes back further, though. They have won seven out of eight Ashes series in this country and 27 out of 38 Tests. If you take out the memorable win of Andrew Strauss' England over a weaker-than-usual Australia in 2010-11, then the previous three series here are 4-1, 5-0 and 5-0. And it could be 5-0 again.  The decisive factor. England do not play well in Australia, and they have not for a long time.If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please "]	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ["In hitting a magnificent 244 not out on day three of the fourth Ashes Test against Australia, Alastair Cook has ensured the questions about his future will go away.I spoke to him after he reached his century on day two and there was disappointment this score has not come when the Ashes were still alive, but he has still gone out and played a magnificent innings. He will have accepted the criticism that came after making just 83 runs in the first three Tests as England surrendered the urn and he will now feel a huge amount of relief and great satisfaction that he knows he is still good enough.I did feel when I was out in Australia for the first two Tests that he needed to convince himself he could still do it. You doubt yourself when you are struggling. The two most important things were:Did he still want to get out there and score runs? It is clear that is still the case.And, is he still seeing the ball well? Now there is no doubt about that either. He has answered a lot of questions about his future.People will say the pressure is off and it doesn't matter, but that is nonsense.He is still going out in front of 80,000 people with people talking about the end of his career. It is still as intense. It still matters.People will also be saying Mitchell Starc wasn't playing because of his injury and Pat Cummins was ill on the first day, that is also nonsense.You can only play what you are up against - England have been without their best player all series in Ben Stokes and that is not devaluing Australia's performance at all. You have to treat each achievement on its own and Cook's is right up there.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        I always thought it was unlikely Cook would be dropped in the near future because there is no obvious replacement to open the batting.I felt it would be down to him and whether he still wanted to do it - getting balls hurled at your head at 90mph is a difficult business after all.If you are a proven quality in any sport, as Alastair Cook is - look at Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal this year in tennis - you don't lose it overnight. It is a combination of things that makes a player move towards the end of his career and a lot of that is willpower and drive to keep doing it. Cook has shown that he has got it and the fact he knew he owed the team will drive him on as well.We have seen throughout Alastair's career that he bats in peaks and troughs. When he is out of form he is very out of form and when he is in form he punishes bowlers. Hopefully now there will be a peak. No doubt next time his footwork goes and head drops to the off-side people will say that's end of his career. That's the way it goes in sport.Like with Cook, there were questions about Stuart Broad and they were genuine concerns.He had been down on pace not just in this series but in the summer and he had struggled with his outswinger to right-handers. He looked like he might really be struggling but it is no surprise that after taking four wickets in the first innings, he has now scored runs as well with 56 in a 100-run partnership with Cook.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        He is a big game player, loves his cricket history and will have loved the fact he was playing in front of a big crowd at the MCG.Now England have a 164-run lead, they have a good opportunity to win this match - it would be disappointing if they didn't.In this series they have shown fight and desire that we didn't see four years ago during the 2013-14 whitewash. The Ashes have gone but of course it still matters, you are playing for your team and the supporters.All of the talk was of a whitewash before this match and England have to make sure that does not happen.If they win this match they will feel very different going into the final Test in Sydney and that is very important."]	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ['For supporters of the England team, a trip to an Ashes series in Australia is top of the bucket list.Not only are there the cricketing cathedrals of the MCG and the Adelaide Oval to be experienced, but also sights like the Sydney Opera House to be seen, beaches to laze on and winter sun to be worshipped.Such a trip comes with a hefty price tag. And, if you want Christmas down under, you run the risk that the Ashes will be gone by the time you get there.These are just some of the tales told by those who have travelled, or will travel, to Australia."I\'ve always loved the overland adventures of Charlie Boorman and Michael Palin, and I love cricket, so I thought why not see if I can do it."I started in London on the second day of The Oval Test in July. I inter-railed around Europe for about four weeks and ended up in Moscow. I took the Trans-Siberian railway to Beijing. From there I went to Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand."I travelled through Malaysia and Singapore. It should have taken two or three days to get from Singapore to Bali, but day after day I was being told there were no ferries and that they wouldn\'t be running for a month. When I did get one, it was a 30-hour journey in horrendous conditions. I was really wondering if it was worth it."After that, there was no commercial way of getting to Australia from Bali without flying, so I knew I had to find a way."I was going daily to the marina in Bali to find a yacht that would take me. It was the wrong time of year - all the yachts were going from Australia rather than the other way. It was coming to the last-chance saloon. A few more days and I would have had to take a flight or miss the first day of the Test, which I wasn\'t prepared to do."There was a cruise ship coming in that I knew about. I\'d contacted them and a got very firm "no". Lots of friends and family got in touch and tried to wear them down. Eventually, the day before, they agreed. That was the first time I knew I was going to make it."It\'s been 25 trains, 22 buses, eight boats and one road trip from Darwin to Brisbane."I went straight to the Gabba. Arriving, completing the challenge, was the best moment of the trip.""I\'ve always been a cricket fan. In 2003 my cricket club were going to Sri Lanka to watch England. I got bitten by the bug and I\'ve hardly missed a tour since."I do whatever it takes to get here - working Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays. For three months of the year one company pays good money for me to work out of hours in offices, when all the staff have gone home. "I\'ll do eight in the morning until four in the afternoon at a house, go home for a shower and some food, then work from six in the evening until two or three in the morning. Every time I get tired, I just think of being out here."I know that, if I want to support the boys, that\'s what I have to do. It\'s a lifestyle choice and not for everyone, but I\'m seen some marvellous cricket."Apart from one Test in the UAE and the trip where we were advised not to go to Bangladesh, I haven\'t missed a tour in 14 years."In the 2011 World Cup in India, I got pick-pocketed. I saw Matt Prior and then met Kevin Pietersen, who found out that I was a decorator. He asked me if I\'d like to work on a house he had just bought, so I hired some workers to help me decorate KP\'s new house."All of the boys look after us. They might follow us on Twitter and help us if we can\'t get hold of a ticket - that enhances my love for them because they are such nice people.   "If all I have to do is work 16 hours a day to be here, it\'s worth it to me. When you work hard for something, you really appreciate it.""I have always loved travelling and wanted to do Australia. I\'m a football fan really. I\'d been to one T20 before, and that was really for the day out. You have to learn somewhere, don\'t you, so I\'m doing all five Tests."A lot of people in my family or who I work with are envious because this is something they have always wanted to do. I\'ve got pals who love their cricket and they were asking, "Why? What are you doing?" I see the cricket as secondary to me enjoying Australia. Everyone thinks I\'m mad and they wouldn\'t be wrong."I love the atmosphere, the singing, the buzz in the stands - it\'s better than Brentford at home, but not as good as Brentford away."Not only that, but I\'m getting to see the five cities where the games are played and I\'ve been to Cairns in between. It\'s been billed as the trip of a lifetime, and that\'s certainly what it has been.""We all played cricket together. In 2000 we said to our wives that we wanted to do a trip together, so we signed a direct debit for £20 a month that has accumulated over the years."At the time, we didn\'t know when it would be, or that it would even be the Ashes. We wanted to watch sport, so it could have been to see the Lions play rugby. Maybe deep down we always knew it would be cricket."About 18 months ago we sat down and decided that the time is right and we settled on this Ashes series. We\'d saved more than £5,000 and we\'ve blown it all on accommodation and flights - we\'re going to the front of the plane. We\'ve rented a house in Coogee and we have tickets for all five days of the Test."I\'m disappointed from a cricketing point of view. We\'ve been pumped. It won\'t take the edge of our trip - we\'ll still enjoy it - but it does rankle with you when you have paid a lot of money."Still, I don\'t wish I\'d spent that money on something else. The cricket is just part of spending two weeks with four of my best friends, which will be really special. We\'ll still enjoy it.""The team had a Whatsapp group that included 70 or 80 people, a lot of them Aussies."At the start of the last Ashes, I said to that group, \'If Australia win the Ashes, I\'ll put £200 behind the bar\'. Josh Pearson, who had actually returned to Australia, said that was an awful bet and upped the stakes."If Australia won, I was paying for him to fly to the 2019 Ashes. If England won, I was getting a paid trip to this series."It was probably the most stupid bet I\'ve ever said yes to - I\'d never go to a casino and whack £1,300 on red or something like that - but, luckily, England managed to win."I had doubts at the start but, because so many people knew about it, there was no way that either of us would back out. I\'m a man of my word and, to be fair to Josh, he has kept the promise."I\'ll be at the fourth and fifth Tests, so I\'ve arrived when the Ashes were lost. Still, there\'s 30 of us going on Boxing Day, so that\'s going to be great experience."I\'m a little bit gutted that the series has turned out the way it has. Maybe we didn\'t expect England to win, but the senior players haven\'t stepped up. The players that we had doubts over have been fantastic. It\'s upsetting, but I do think we can win one Test."I saw Josh for the first time in three years when I arrived in Sydney."I\'m not sure I\'d be taking a similar bet in the future - I might have to make some South African friends and take it up with them.""I\'ve been back to England for every Ashes tour since I moved to Australia. Me and my now wife returned to the UK to get married and that coincided with an Ashes tour. We went on honeymoon in Spain and, two days in, I told her that I was flying to London for the Lord\'s Test."Our daughter was born 13 months ago, so my mum wanted us to return to the UK for Christmas and her birthday. I was at the Gabba for the first Test of this series, but I am the die-hard England fan who lives in Australia that has actually left the country during the Ashes. My friends can\'t believe it."On the last Ashes tour, when England were getting beaten in Adelaide, we learned about the Adelaide Barmies. We thought they would follow their footsteps in Brisbane. When this series was about a year away, we got our act together."There are so many ex-pats, but it\'s hard for them to sit together at a Test because you\'re usually only allowed to buy eight tickets at once. It took some persuasion, but Cricket Australia allowed us to sit as a group of ex-pats, next to the Barmy Army, so we could support our team in unison."When you live so far away from the place that you still call home, sport is something that brings you nearer to like-minded people. At the first Test, I was able to meet people who had previously just been names on the Brisbane Barmies Facebook page. That was fantastic. We hope to be doing the same for every Gabba Ashes Test."']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['Those are the words of  who will begin day two of the fifth Ashes Test unbeaten on 55 but without the reassuring presence of his captain, Joe Root, beside him.And rather than laying the foundations for a potentially match-winning first-innings total, he will instead attempt to guide an out-of-form Moeen Ali and an elongated tail to a respectable score against the new ball and a fired-up Australian pace attack.England will resume on 233-5 after losing  - the first being Root, caught at square leg, for 83.So should England be expecting more from Root? Or, as Malan says, should we instead be patient in the assumption he will one day "convert as well as the other greats".Thursday\'s innings was the fourth time Root has passed 50 in this series and the fourth time he has failed to reach three figures.His opposite number Smith has also passed 50 four times but has turned three of those half-centuries into hundreds - two of which were unbeaten and one which was a double (239 to be precise).Such stark statistics are amplified by the balls faced by each captain in the series. Smith has received 1,258 deliveries in this Ashes series to Root\'s 604."He knows he wants to convert more 50s into 100s," said England coach Paul Farbrace. "It\'s not something any coach needs to sit him down and say \'do you realise you need to convert more fifties?\'"So why can\'t Root convert in the same manner as his opposite number? He has converted only five out of 22 fifties since the start of 2016."Steve Smith converts fifties into hundreds because he just plays his own way, without risk," former England captain Michael Vaughan told Test Match Special."Joe Root gets out between 50 and 100 because he plays unnecessarily risky shots. To become a great player, he needs to realise when the hook or pull is getting him into trouble and shelve them."Root\'s fellow Yorkshireman Geoffrey Boycott went one further, saying: "England will always be an up-and-down side until they become a better, more solid batting side. "You can\'t win Test matches unless you bat better and put decent totals on the board."Root, it should be pointed out, averages 40 in the series - considerably more than two of the three batsman ahead of him in the order.As England look to plan for two Tests in New Zealand in March, they will surely have concerns over the returns of opener Mark Stoneman and number three James Vince.Both fell in the 20s on day one in Sydney, and both average in the 20s for the series. Neither man has reached three figures down under.Hampshire\'s Vince, in particular, looks susceptible as he continues to get out in a similar manner - 11 of his 19 Test dismissals have been caught by the keeper or the slips."I don\'t think Vince reads a situation well, or the tactics the opposition are throwing at him," said Vaughan."I think 95% of Vince\'s runs come from pure shots so, visually, he looks as good as any England player we\'ve seen."But at this level, it\'s not about looking great, it\'s about scoring big runs, and he hasn\'t done that yet."Surrey left-hander Stoneman was undone by a short ball at the SCG, tamely fencing a Pat Cummins delivery to the keeper.However, former England batsman Ed Smith believes the left-hander is somebody England should persevere with."Stoneman has a big problem with the short ball," said Smith.

You would expect England would want the likes of Broad and Anderson in those conditions.Cook is different. He's 33 on Christmas Day, and it's easy to rush to conclusions about the former captain.His career, in terms of form, has always been a bit of a rollercoaster.In his mind he is aware it's not as easy for him as it once was because of his body, so maybe the days of us saying he can play as long as he wants are gone.He does have a settled life outside of cricket and he loves being on the farm with this family but he is one of the most stubborn men I have met in this sport.He would want to go out on his own terms, rather than being dropped because of a lack of runs, and because of that I can see him continuing too.England, let's remember, aren't the only team who struggle away from home.It's becoming a recognised pattern around the world whereby the touring side tends to lose. England, for example, have a very good record at home to Australia.Much of it is down to the shortening of tours, a lack of preparation time which players are now afforded and, crucially, the standard of the opposition they are presented with in their warm-up games.The team England faced before the first Test was not good enough and a line has to be drawn in the sand. It's not just Australia who have done it, everyone does it - including England.Gone are the days when a touring team would face a first-choice county XI and the match would be taken seriously.Quite frankly, everyone need to grow up and realise it's not in the best interests of the game for teams to prepare for international cricket against sub-standard opposition.England missed pace badly in this series - and I realise we're going over old ground slightly - but I'm still surprised by the non-selection of Liam Plunkett.I know he didn't play much first-class cricket last summer, but I don't care about that. The bloke has got pace and that's what England needed in Australia.Additionally, I still find the selection of 20-year-old leg-spinner Mason Crane utterly bizarre. I don't see how England were ever going to play him. It's extraordinary really. Moeen hasn't bowled well but England just couldn't make a change.I would like to see Durham fast bowler Mark Wood given a run-out in the fourth Test - fitness permitting - because England have got to ensure they do everything in their power to avoid losing 5-0.A lot of England supporters will be travelling over for Christmas and New Year, having saved up for years, and they'll want to see some good cricket and pride.The Boxing Day Test in Melbourne and the New Year's Test in Sydney are sporting occasions people dream about attending.England have to continue to give it their best shot for the sake of their supporters and their own pride."]	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['The Scottish FA\'s lease on Hampden ends in 2020 and the governing body is currently considering all its options in consultation with stakeholders in the game.A  fans by the Scottish Football Supporters Association found that 15% wanted to retain Hampden as the national stadium.Murrayfield, the home of Scottish rugby, is one potential alternative. Others involve playing major games around the county.BBC Scotland canvassed the views of players, managers and former players, with a range of views on the best option for Scottish football."I would look at other options. There are certain matches that need to go round the country, where we have some fantastic stadiums. I don\'t know why we need to play all our matches there.""I\'m all for [Hampden]. I\'m a traditionalist that way. I\'ve got some really good memories of Hampden, some not so good, but I do feel that it\'s something we should cherish."There\'s nothing wrong with taking certain international games round the country. We can make Hampden better in terms of atmosphere, but I would want to have Hampden there rather than lose it.""I\'m not really too bothered. I\'m not a traditionalist. Hampden has been a great stadium down the years, people who have played there will have great memories, people who have gone to watch will have great memories, but times move on. If it\'s time to change, it\'s time to change. But if it\'s also decided to stay at Hampden, that\'s not going to be a bad thing either."I enjoyed [Murrayfield] because we won [when Kilmarnock beat Hearts], but it is a rugby stadium, historically. There are many arguments, and money will talk. Whichever is most cost effective will be the hub of the decision.""I\'ve played in some very big cup finals - and blessed to win a couple there - and it\'s good, but I believe it misses something. I\'m all for nostalgia and history, but I wouldn\'t be bothered if we moved our games to Murrayfield. That\'s a terrific stadium, there\'s a case for it."I\'ve heard that an awful lot. I know Murrayfield has a big track round it, but there\'s something extra about it. Hampden hasn\'t got it, and I\'ve played in Old Firm cup final wins where it was a brilliant atmosphere. But there\'s just something missing from an Ibrox or a Celtic Park, and a Tynecastle. I wouldn\'t be bothered by a move.""From a players\' point of view, I\'ve had some great memories there, it\'s a special place for me. I\'m a big fan of Hampden, it generates a great atmosphere when it\'s full. I can understand why some games, like the friendlies, you could move them away to places like Tynecastle, Pittodrie, when it will be a lower crowd. But Hampden should be used as the national stadium."The games I\'ve played in, it certainly compares. I think back to the big games for Scotland and the atmosphere was excellent. I\'ve played in games at Celtic Park for Scotland and the fans are the same."You go there for the semi-final and the final of the cup, and that\'s when you say, \'we\'re going to Hampden\'. It\'s a special place. I get that there\'s a running track and for fans behind the goals it can be difficult. Can we redevelop it, bring the seating closer? I don\'t know if that\'s an option. There\'s so much history there and I\'m a big fan [of Hampden].""Our record isn\'t fantastic at Hampden. Having experienced a cup final at Celtic Park, that was incredible, so I\'m all for moving it to the likes of Celtic Park, Ibrox, even Tynecastle. Obviously we\'ve experienced Murrayfield and it was half-empty but still not as good. Celtic Park would be a great choice.""I lived in the Gorbals, not too far from Hampden, and I\'ve been there many times. For me, it\'s always been a wonderful occasion. I don\'t see why it should change from being the national stadium."When the Tartan Army are in full [voice], it\'s there for everyone to hear. I was fortunate to play in a cup final there for Airdrie and there was a terrific atmosphere. Everyone has an opinion, but it should always be the national stadium."']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ["Jelena Dokic's successes during her 16-year tennis career came at a heavy personal price, she says.The Yugoslavia-born Australian was once ranked fourth in the world, and reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon in 2000, but she claims she suffered years of mental and physical abuse from her father Damir, who coached her from an early age. she was whipped with a leather belt and kicked in the shins if she did not train well, and that she was regularly left bruised and bloodied.Now 34 and a coach herself, she has released a book and has told BBC World Service's  programme about name-calling, being evicted from her hotel and having suicidal thoughts.That should have been one of the great highlights, but after the match my father thought I was a disgrace and an embarrassment and didn't allow me to come back to the hotel.I had to stay at Wimbledon in the players' lounge that afternoon and that evening and try to sleep there. I hid on a couch hoping no-one was going to find me, but the cleaners did at 11pm. The referee was called and I had to find somewhere else to sleep for the night - no money, no credit card, nothing.People saw what my dad was like, how he was behaving - we all know the incidents at Wimbledon, US Open, Australian Open. And based on that alone, you would think that some people would maybe come up to you and just ask you how you were doing. Just a kind word would have been enough - but it didn't happen.And I also didn't understand the media, because everything that he was doing was seen as funny and a joke. The incident at Wimbledon with the flag, and the US Open. He was the punchline and a headline, but a funny one. It wasn't funny because a 14 or 15-year-old girl was going home with this person.That wasn't my decision at all. I love Australia, and I was really grateful to the country for giving me what I got when I came as a refugee as an 11-year-old. I loved playing for Australia and I felt completely Australian - he took that away from me. I was only 17. I was made to do that and show that publicly which was completely not me.It wasn't about power, it was for me more a way out because I felt like I was letting a lot of people down. I did leave my brother behind and he was eight years younger, about 11 years old, and I had a lot of guilt and that was kind of the way my dad made me feel - he didn't let me talk to my brother for about five years, six years, so it was very, very hard on me. I had this guilt about whether I did the right thing and he constantly made me feel worthless, I lost a lot of confidence and self-esteem and even when I left home, he still put me through hell and really made life difficult.I just felt everybody would be better off if I wasn't here. All I wanted was to have a normal life and to be able to play tennis in peace. I did try to reconcile with him a few times over the years, and it just hasn't been possible. It's hard to communicate with someone who thinks they've done nothing wrong and has shown no remorse.I've done absolutely everything that I possibly could have done for him and my family - when I left home I gave him all my money and continued to do so for years. But it got to a stage where it wasn't about tennis anymore; it was about whether I was going to ever be able to live a normal life again after almost committing suicide. I lived for almost 30 years in some kind of pain, so I think it was time to move on and look forward to the future. I've got a lot to be happy about and I just need to leave people behind that don't have my best interests at heart.Do I wish sometimes that I had a normal father and a normal family unit and support? Absolutely. But you can't choose your parents and I'm kind of lucky to be here, luckier than most I still think."]	 CATEGORY:Sports

He didn\'t know whether I\'d make a full recovery. "You\'re lucky to be alive," he said. But all I could think was \'can I leave? I\'ve got an Olympics to train for\'. I felt like my dream was being taken away from me and it was heart breaking. It all started when I was in Nigeria - I contracted malaria but I didn\'t know I had it. I went to the Dominican Republic for another holiday and that was when my symptoms started to get really rough.I emailed the doctor at British Athletics and I told him my urine was dark, really really dark. "Are you sure it\'s not alcohol or you haven\'t been drinking and staying hydrated?" he asked. But I was hydrated and it was getting quite worrying. Even with the symptoms, I got home from the Dominican Republic and I went back to training at Loughborough. I was in denial for a long time. But I knew I wasn\'t running properly and I felt weird. That\'s when I realised it was something much more serious. As soon as I stopped that session, the fever kicked in.I went to get a urine and a blood test and within 12 hours the chief medical officer got back to me. "There\'s something wrong with your kidneys, you need to see a specialist," he said.I had no way to get to London other than to drive myself, with a raging fever, to St John\'s Hospital.I sometimes complain about doing a tough workout but the symptoms I had were beyond anything I could have imagined.I had a fever, I had vomiting, stomach cramps and headaches. I was going from hot to cold, shivering, and waking up in a pool of sweat without knowing why it had happened or where it had come from. By the time they diagnosed me and told me I had malaria my fever was reaching 40C and they said "we need to throw you in an ice tub", but I couldn\'t move, I could barely breathe. The nurse had to put bags of ice around the bed because I couldn\'t get to the tub - I was in so much pain.I was then put in quarantine and I wasn\'t allowed to leave.  I couldn\'t even go outside and I remember gazing out the window and thinking how amazing London looked. I didn\'t know if I was ever going to see fresh air again.I also had to learn to walk again. When I was moved to the ward I tried to do laps and I was fighting with the nurses because they said I should be in bed resting. But I needed to walk, I needed some sort of movement, I needed to be active - this was my winter training, I should have been out on the track. The day I got released from hospital, it was my birthday and as soon as I walked outside I took a deep breath of air. I was so thankful to have the opportunity to do that, because not many people are able to survive it. I think if I was a regular person I wouldn\'t have known it was malaria. I would have just taken some tablets and thought it was a cold. They told me if I\'d have left it a day or two days later it could have been fatal. I\'m thankful that I caught it as early as I did. I went through the absolute worst in that hospital and I nearly had everything taken away.But as soon as I could walk again, I started running. No matter how much the training sessions killed me, I was just so grateful to be there.Originally the European Championships weren\'t in my plans before the 2016 Rio Olympics, but because of the circumstances that led to my performances at the national championships - the Olympic trials - I had to go to the Europeans in Amsterdam to get a medal. So nine months after contracting malaria I won my first global individual medal - a bronze in the 400m before gold in the 4x400m relay.That didn\'t get me an individual place at Rio 2016 but I was selected for the relay and I said "I\'m not coming back to the UK without an Olympic medal". And in August, I got everything I\'d ever dreamed of. Alongside my team-mates Christine Ohuruogu, Emily Diamond and Eilidh Doyle we won bronze in the 4x400m relay.I remember shaking on the podium. I\'d been at the Europeans and got a medal, been to the Commonwealths and the World Championships in Beijing, but an Olympic medal? It was amazing. You just want to stare at it and hold it, it\'s like a new born child that you\'ve just created and you don\'t want to let go.Only a handful of people knew what had happened to me in the months building up to the Olympics. I told 400m runner Martin Rooney because we were training partners and I also told long jumper Shara Proctor.I didn\'t know how people would react so I decided to keep the fact I\'d had malaria a secret, even from my 4x400m relay team-mates.I am always accountable for everything I do and if I had a bad race in 2016 I didn\'t want anyone to use the malaria as an excuse. I just wanted to focus on the season and not think about it. Even when I got the Olympic medal, I wasn\'t too sure about telling people - I felt exposed at the time but the response when I finally did was amazing and completely overwhelming.Sometimes I still get nightmares about what happened in the hospital. I didn\'t want to have to remember it but speaking about it gives me a sense of relief and closure.I am now an ambassador for  UK - an amazing charity who are bringing the disease to the forefront. They\'re teaching people that this is a global disease and not just in Africa.People are sometimes worried about going to Africa because of Malaria but Nigeria is like home for me and I love going back - it\'s where my parents were born and bred. After my dad passed away in 2012 I said I\'d go back as often as possible and I might even retire there one day.I know many people who have passed away from Malaria. I have a cousin who died from the disease so it makes me truly grateful that I survived and am able to tell my story. In terms of my performances on the track, I\'m not in exactly the same shape as before. Over the last two years my times have been up and down, but I don\'t think that\'s related to malaria. I\'m just feeling my way with the 400m.I\'m definitely capable of running as quick as I have done in the past and malaria by no means is going to stop me. The biggest thing I took away from this experience is strength, strength I never knew I had.We\'ve got the Commonwealth Games in the Gold Coast and the European Championships in Germany next year so hopefully there are more medals to come.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

Think of them as less of a race and more of an event where hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people come together to create an electric atmosphere. Participation offers a chance to run, walk or even dance your way to the finish line as well as a feeling of camaraderie with the people sharing the experience with you.Once you reach the end there is a feeling of accomplishment that energises you, whether you've walked a mile or run a marathon.And thankfully, mass participation events come in all shapes and sizes so you will find one that is for you.

That simple ethos helped Ujah get over his failure to make the 100m final at the World Championships in London in August. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        After missing qualification by 0.02 seconds, he ran the opening leg for Britain\'s gold-winning 4x100m team seven days later.Less than a fortnight after that, he beat new world champion Justin Gatlin to win the prestigious Diamond League final in Zurich.Ujah describes that victory as "redemption" for his individual showing at London 2017. In 2018, he hopes to start talking about domination.Jamaican great Usain Bolt\'s retirement, coupled with Gatlin\'s advancing years, has put athletics\' headline event in a state of flux. The heir to the throne is not immediately apparent.Ujah\'s personal best is a relatively modest 9.96 seconds - his time of 9.95 at May\'s Diamond League meeting in Eugene is not counted because it was wind assisted. He was only joint-11th fastest in the world last year. But he has five Diamond League victories this season - and that, combined with the fact that London produced the slowest major 100m final for six years, suggests his big-race consistency, rather than eye-catching times, may be key to getting in the short-distance shake-down.Ujah has had a close-up look at one of the other men emerging on the 100m scene, as Andre De Grasse also trains under McMillan\'s tutelage in Arizona.The 22-year-old Canadian won bronze behind Bolt and Gatlin at Rio 2016, but was denied a tilt at this year\'s world title by a hamstring injury."His relaxed style is a big strength," Ujah says. "Andre might not turn up to training at his best, but when it comes to the race, he will be a different athlete."In training, he is bantering, having jokes."In the build-up to the Oslo Diamond League for instance, he was a metre or so behind me the whole week in training, playing possum, and then when it came to the race, he pipped me on the line."Literally a week before the World Championships, he did the same thing. I started slowing down as well. Coach [McMillan] found it funny but warned us he would stop the session."It is a nice rivalry, it\'s friendly. We talk on the line and have fun, but when it gets down to the \'on marks, set, go\', we are rivals."American Christian Coleman, who won silver in London and is the fastest man this year, is a "true champion and warrior", adds Ujah.Jamaica\'s Julian Forte, who ran a personal best of 9.91 this season, and Coleman\'s compatriot Trayvon Bromell, who tied for 2015 world bronze with De Grasse, get name-checked by Ujah as athletes to watch too.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        But he also expressed optimism regarding the prospects of Britain\'s new generation.Reece Prescod, who won the British title after selectors let a cramping Ujah know he could miss the final and still be a "strong possibility" for the World Championships team, finished seventh in London.Fellow 21-year-old Ojie Edoburun is a little further behind in his development, but a medallist at major youth and junior championships.The trio met up at Ujah\'s house for a barbecue at the end of the season and the host hopes they will be keeping each company in major finals soon."British sprinting is really moving on at a crucial time," he adds. "It is time for us a nation to establish ourselves on the scene."I think what I have done, what Reece has done, will get everyone ready to train hard over the winter to get ready for next season and build on it. "Once everyone starts realising that sub-10 is just a number and you can run it whenever really, we will start seeing British sprinting dipping under the 9.90 mark and going faster."The smaller the numbers get on the clock, the bigger the rewards. Ujah can attest that after picking up a $50,000 (£39,000) prize cheque for his Diamond League final win."I have been going shopping for clothes, a bit of technology, but, mainly, I have been saving smartly," he laughs.The experience banked - of victory in Zurich, disappointment in London and mood music in Arizona - might be Ujah\'s canniest investment of all.

The best of the rest stressing, straining and stretching in his wake, but ultimately unable to reel in Mo Farah.It played out again in Zurich on Thursday night as Farah took revenge on Muktar Edris - who inflicted a rare defeat in the World Championship 5,000m final earlier this month -  and $50,000 (£39,000) in prize money.But we won\'t see it again, at least on the track.Farah\'s victory in Switzerland marked his final race before the 34-year-old turns his attention to the road and the differing challenges of the marathon.As he heads for the tarmac, BBC Sport takes a look back at the Briton\'s glittering journey and the secrets behind his track success.A long way. However you cut it.Since the start of 2006 - his breakthrough season - Farah has run 693,864m on the track.That equates to just over 430 miles, further than the distance separating Plymouth and Newcastle.Or 1,734 laps of the track.Or maybe, when you have racked up the training mileage Farah has in his career it seems like small fry.A Runner\'s World article in 2014 -  - detailed a typical training week for Farah. It clocked in at 126-135 miles a week, meaning the distance covered in his 11 years on the track would be outstripped by a single month\'s work behind the scenes.Like the opposition on the track, Farah has long since left his domestic rivals behind in the record books.He has 10 world and Olympic gold medals. By that measure, no-one else comes close. Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill has four after a recent upgrade to gold, while Jonathan Edwards, Daley Thompson and Christine Ohuruogu have three.Linford Christie has two, as do greats such as Dame Kelly Holmes, Sally Gunnell and Lord Coe.Instead you have to look to global greats to put Farah\'s medal haul in the shade.Usain Bolt, Allyson Felix and Carl Lewis have all benefited from relay medals that were never on offer to Farah.On the other hand, some of history\'s greats did not have the chance to win world medals at all, with the championships having only been founded in 1983.In terms of time, Farah is only the 16th fastest man of all time over 10,000m and the 31st fastest man of all time over 5,000m.But when it mattered in major finals, he delivered.Farah\'s modus operandi has been always clear - hit the bell in contention and then prove stronger and faster over the final 400m than anyone else.What has been extraordinary is Farah\'s ability to maintain that devastating last-lap speed over so many years.Across his 12 global finals - including his silver medals in the world 10,000m in 2011 and world 5,000m in 2017 - Farah\'s last laps have consistently been lightning quick."Farah\'s last four 100m sections in the Rio 5,000m final were 13.6, 13.0, 13.3 and 12.8 seconds for a total of 52.7," says BBC Sport\'s athletics statistician Mark Butler."Not bad for someone who could only clock 12.98 seconds from blocks behind Anthony Joshua and Robbie Grabarz in the 100m race at the 2012 edition of \'Superstars\'. No-one else can generate that sort of speed when global golds are at stake"It\'s worth noting that he was able to produce that sort of speed way before he joined up with coach Alberto Salazar. "At the 2006 European Cup in Malaga, Farah completed the last lap of the 3,000m in 52.21."In Zurich on Thursday night, 11 years on and over the longer distance, he produced a 52.61 final lap."Along with Farah\'s tactical acumen, no-one else can generate that sort of speed when global golds are at stake."']	 CATEGORY:Sports

I didn\'t prepare any speech," Farah, 34, said via a video link after the show.Boxer Anthony Joshua, rated favourite to win, was just 18 votes behind Peacock in fourth place.Farah, the winner of 10 major global titles, has just moved back to England from the United States and was not in Liverpool for the awards show.In a chaotic interview from London during the programme, his stepdaughter Rhianna was alongside him, helping to take care of Farah\'s two-year-old son Hussein who was suffering from a sickness bug and wanting cuddles.As the result was announced, millions of viewers saw Farah\'s initial delight at winning the award before the video link cut out.After the show, the Somali-born Londoner told the media: "I can\'t stop staring at the trophy. I do owe it to the public, to the people who voted for me and supported me."It\'s incredible, amazing. To be honest with you, I never thought I would win having come so close before."What a night. It\'s been very entertaining. I\'ve got my son pulling my mic and Rhianna shouting out. [Presenter] Gabby [Logan] was talking to me and I couldn\'t even hear what she was saying.

But I guess you just got to do what you\'ve got to do and over the past 10 years I\'ve been very lucky with the career I\'ve had and the support I\'ve had," he said."The people who voted at home for me and have supported me on the track - without their support it\'s a long road and I wouldn\'t have done it without them, they keep me grafting."It\'s been an incredible night. I do wish I was there. It would have been nice to give back to the people. The most important thing in my life is my family."My son\'s ill, the twins have been sick. It\'s been a pretty hard transition moving back from the US to here. They\'ve been struggling a bit."You saw my son and, in fact, he was throwing up everywhere in the other room."\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Farah won with 83,524 votes, ahead of World Superbikes champion Rea (80,567) and Paralympic sprint champion Peacock (73,429).Joshua was fourth  in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley, and retaining his WBA and IBF world heavyweight titles with victory over Carlos Takam.For Farah, a third successive World Championship 10,000m gold medal was the highlight of a year in which he also won a world 5,000m silver, missing out on a fifth major championships distance double in a row.The four-time Olympic champion received a knighthood from the Queen at Buckingham Palace in November.He bowed out from his track career with a  at the Diamond League event in Zurich in August and will now concentrate on road races."I\'m looking forward to the marathon training. It\'s not easy, but it\'s exciting and you have to graft. My challenge is to compete fully in the marathon and go out as far as I can - and, who knows, get to the 2020 Olympics," he said.Asked if an Olympic marathon victory would top his achievements so far, he said: "It would definitely top it. There\'s no athlete that\'s ever gone all the way up from the track straight to the marathon and been successful."I want to do the marathon and go all the way. If I\'m in great shape and things are good, I will go for 2020."Farah becomes the first long-distance runner to win the Sports Personality award since Paula Radcliffe in 2002.Former Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill, who  paid tribute."There was a bit of bit of drama at the end with the result, but I think Mo\'s had a fantastic year, a fantastic career," she said."It shows that he\'s definitely got the public behind him. He wouldn\'t have won otherwise. I think he will be very happy."He definitely deserves it and it\'s great to see athletics back on the top again." \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        It was a night of high emotion with the parents of Bradley Lowery given a standing ovation by the 11,000 crowd at the Echo Arena as they collected a posthumous honour.Sunderland fan and club mascot Bradley, who died aged six from a rare form of cancer, was named the The award, for achievement in the face of adversity, is in memory of the BBC presenter who died of cancer in 1999."I\'m so proud to be here to collect this on Bradley\'s behalf," his mum Gemma said."It\'s amazing to know that even though he was my baby, the nation are still behind us.

CONTENT:  ['World champion sprinter Justin Gatlin says he is "shocked and surprised" at doping allegations made against his coach and an agent.Athletics anti-doping officials have begun an investigation into what the president of the sport\'s governing body called "serious allegations" about Dennis Mitchell and Robert Wagner.The  Wagner - an agent linked to Gatlin - offered to "illicitly supply performance-enhancing drugs" to undercover reporters.A video released by the Telegraph features a man the newspaper says is Wagner insinuating Gatlin is taking banned drugs, "just like every other sprinter in America".The paper also said Gatlin\'s coach, former Olympic gold medallist Mitchell, told reporters that athletes are able to get away with doping because the drugs they use cannot be detected by tests.Both deny the allegations. on Tuesday, Gatlin said he "fired" Mitchell "as soon as I found out about this".The 35-year-old American said he is "not using and have not used" performance-enhancing drugs.He added: "All legal options are on the table as I will not allow others to lie about me like this."The Telegraph said its journalists had posed as representatives of a film company wanting to make a sports film who were looking for a coach to train their star to look like an athlete.The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) - set up by the sport\'s world governing body the IAAF - and the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) said they had opened an investigation into the claims."Investigations stemming from tips and whistleblowers play a critical role in anti-doping efforts," Usada said in a statement. "We are presently co-ordinating with the Athletics Integrity Unit in order to investigate these claims fully."As with all investigations, we encourage individuals with information to come forward as an important tool to help protect clean athletes. Importantly, individuals are innocent unless and until the established process determines otherwise. It\'s only fair to let due process occur before jumping to any conclusions."IAAF president Lord Coe said: "These allegations are extremely serious and I know the independent Athletics Integrity Unit will investigate in accordance with its mandate."\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) said it would monitor the AIU investigation and offer support."I hope that first of all that the journalists from the Telegraph will make their information available to the investigators. We will monitor and offer assistance where we can," said Wada president Sir Craig Reedie."I think the investigation will concentrate on the allegation that everybody is using performance enhancing drugs. It\'s an easy allegation to make but it needs to be tied down - I\'m not sure the evidence exists to support it."Gatlin, who has served two doping bans, won 100m gold at August\'s World Championships in London, beating Usain Bolt in the Jamaican\'s final individual 100m race before retiring.Gatlin\'s legal representatives said the sprinter had more than five years\' worth of official drugs tests to show "he has never tested positive for any banned substance", the paper reported.In a statement to the Telegraph, Mitchell said: "I never suggested in any way that any of my current athletes used any banned substances or that I was familiar with training any of my current athletes with those substances."Wagner told the paper: "I wasn\'t involved in doping. Obviously I played along because I knew what was going on. I had to get them hooked."\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        ']	 CATEGORY:Sports

"We didn\'t realise what was happening, but yeah, obviously we had the same schedule in Rio and this year we just kind of blossomed up. "We are looking forward to the Commonwealth Games together, that\'s for sure."The couple now live in San Diego, with Butchart having switched coaches to work with Terrence Mahon, who is also Sharp\'s coach.And, as much as the move was convenient for the pair\'s living arrangements, Butchart stressed that changing coaches was a career choice first and foremost."Always coaching reasons, yeah, it always comes down to athletics first," he added. "We\'ve always said that since day one - it\'s always to be athletics number one, so I had to go to Terrence for my progression."Sharp, an 800m silver medallist at the Glasgow 2014 Games, says having Butchart around is already benefitting her on the track as well as off it."It just makes it a bit more fun, a bit more light-hearted to be able to go out and do social things as well as just training, so it makes training camps a lot better," the 27-year-old said. "Just generally a lot more fun."Andrew is a lot more laid back it in his approach. I\'ve definitely taken that on board. "I can get quite stressed-out on competition days, so I\'ve tried to be a bit more laid back and have fun because, at the end of the day, that\'s what it\'s about, having fun."And, in terms of the pair becoming an item, Sharp admitted it took some friends by surprise."People took some time to get used to it because they knew us both as individuals and we are both quite different," she added. "People couldn\'t understand how it worked, but then they spent time with us together, they see that we get on so well and we are actually quite similar in some respects."']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['World Para-athletics champion sprinter Sophie Kamlish says she would rather not be known as the next "Blade Babe".The 21-year-old, who had her lower leg amputated aged seven after a birth defect, runs using a prosthetic blade.Her Dutch rival Marlou van Rhijn, a double amputee and three-time Paralympic champion, goes by that tag but Kamlish is not keen on adopting it."It is reducing me down to the carbon fibre thing that I use to race on," the Bath-based athlete told BBC Sport. "I guess it\'s not an insult, but I don\'t think it would be a total compliment either."I suppose if you don\'t feel uncomfortable with the label then there is nothing wrong with it. But I don\'t think I like being described as Blade Babe very much."[British two-time Paralympic gold medallist] Jonnie Peacock and the other male amputee sprinters generally haven\'t been described as a Blade Babe, so I guess there is a gender thing going on."Kamlish set a new T44 world record in the heats on her way to winning gold at the World Championships in London in July for her first global title. And she will take part in her first big competition of 2018 over 60m at the Indoor Grand Prix in Glasgow on 25 February.The London title also helped to make up in some way for her Rio Paralympics disappointment, where she also set a world record in the heats but missed out on a medal in the final - an experience which she said was "upsetting".Despite standing at only 5ft 3in, Kamlish, a self-confessed nerd who is studying animation and illustration at Kingston School of Art, is a distinctive figure on the track thanks to the flower she always sports in her hair and being one of the few athletes who wears glasses."Because of the glasses, people assume I\'m cleverer than I am," she laughs."I\'ve worn them since I was four and can\'t do without them.

"It was tiny things that added up and those are the sort of things that people don\'t see as offensive when they say them. I think it is thoughtlessness rather than nastiness."But you internalise those things and you can end up with the idea that disability is something negative and that is the main thing that needs to change."Disability isn\'t something that is bad or needs to be cured. It\'s just another cool part of the world and I hope that change is happening in schools."I\'m sure there have been more educational things for teachers and I always speak my mind now about how disabled people are treated."']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has been accused of "cowardice" for failing to help a former Russian anti-doping official turned whistleblower. Grigory Rodchenkov, whose revelations of state-sponsored cheating led to the  fled to the US two years ago and remains in hiding. But his lawyer - Jim Walden - has now accused Russia of "stepping up its retaliation" by secretly lobbying for his extradition. "If they succeeded, Dr Rodchenkov would face death and torture at their hands," he warned. Walden said the IOC had "refused to lift a finger to help him", and suggested threats to his client\'s safety may force him to stop providing evidence to the authorities. The IOC said it "categorically denies" Walden\'s claim that it had refused to help, stressing it had sought special protection for Rodchenko as a whistleblower - though pointed out "it is not in its powers to protect witnesses".Rodchenkov\'s shock revelations triggered investigations by both the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and the IOC. Earlier this month, the IOC confirmed "the systematic manipulation of the anti-doping rules and system". Russia has repeatedly denied running a state-sponsored doping programme, but was told its athletes could only compete under a neutral flag in Pyeongchang in February. Russia\'s investigative committee has said it will ask the US to extradite Rodchenkov, the former head of Moscow\'s anti-doping laboratory. President Vladimir Putin has also suggested the whistleblower may have been drugged by the FBI to coax a confession, something Walden described as "comical". "Russia knows that the IOC is planning to rely on Dr Rodchenkov\'s testimony at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, where dozens of banned Russian athletes have filed appeals from their personal lifetime bans for doping," he said. "Obviously, Russia would like to silence Dr Rodchenkov and make his testimony in these cases impossible.  "The real actor with power in this drama is the IOC, which could fully ban even \'neutral\' Russian athletes from the Olympics, prevent them from marching in closing ceremonies, or ban them from future Games based on Russia\'s continued intransigence.  "Unfortunately, the IOC - who relied so prominently on Dr Rodchenkov\'s testimony in banning Russia from the Olympics - refuses to lift a finger to help him."The IOC must act. I asked to meet with its officials... I made suggestions on how the IOC could end this campaign against Dr Rodchenkov, by requiring that Russia cease its retaliation... I was told - point blank - that the IOC would take no action against Russia for retaliating against Dr Rodchenkov."Despite being banned from the Olympics, Russia is preparing to host the World Cup next year - Fifa is under pressure to act after allegations that a host of Russian footballers were beneficiaries of the country\'s doping conspiracy.But Walden issued the following warning: "Perhaps if Dr Rodchenkov were \'no longer available\', the corrupt persons who fought against a full ban against Russia would be happy. A problem would be solved. "The currently unreported remainder of Dr Rodchenkov\'s evidence of international corruption and bribery would be buried."As the IOC knows, Dr Rodchenkov also has information about doping in soccer, so Fifa could ignore any evidence of doping by Russia\'s soccer team. "My job is, among other things, to ensure Dr Rodchenkov\'s safety at all costs. Although he is a courageous man and fully committed to co-operation, as his lawyer I have to consider whether he should continue to compromise his own safety in order to provide evidence to the IOC.  "One thing is certain - if the IOC\'s inaction is what whistleblowers can expect, no whistleblower should ever again come forward with information about fraud in the Olympics. Had I known of the IOC\'s cowardice, I might have urged a different path."Walden\'s claims were firmly rejected by the IOC, however."The lOC categorically denies Mr Walden\'s claim that the IOC has taken no action and the ridiculous assertion that we would like it if Mr Rodchenko \'were not to be available\'," it said."The IOC co-ordinated with Wada (the World Anti-Doping Agency) who wrote to the Russian sports minister and the lOC to the Russian Olympic Committee to make it clear that Mr Rodchenko deserved protection as a whistleblower."The IOC is in contact with Mr Rodchenkov\'s lawyers through its own lawyers and has never at any time refused any dialogue."']	 CATEGORY:Sports

Despite senior Scottish athletics officials voicing hopes she  the 24-year-old is adamant she is sticking to her original plan."It was a decision that was made a good few years ago that I knew I wasn\'t going to be running there," Muir told BBC Scotland."It wasn\'t going to work out with my final year of vet medicine, my finals in May and placements all the way up to the end of April. "It will be difficult not to be there. You want to race as much as you can."I think if it was a little bit closer you might be able to get away with it, but Australia is a little bit difficult so no, I\'m afraid it\'s kind of set in stone that I\'m not doing it."If anyone thinks Muir is putting athletics on the back-burner though, after a highly successful 2017, they should think again.After breaking the British indoor 5,000m record, winning double gold at the European Indoor Championships and finishing fourth in the 1500m and sixth in the 5,000m at last summer\'s (outdoor) World Championships in London, Muir still has plenty of targets this year. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Foremost in her thoughts is the World Indoor Championships in Birmingham from 1-4 March."I\'m really excited to have another home championships, and another great crowd, after the [outdoor] World Championships last year," she said."I\'m hopefully going to get there and run another good performance."Muir has yet to decide if she will double up in the 1500m and 3,000m, as she did last year at the European Indoors in Belgrade.  Organisers have now made the 3,000m a straight final, on Thursday 1 March, with the 1500m heats the following evening and the 1500m final on Saturday, 3 March."The timetable does allow for the two but I am not sure yet whether I am doing two or just the one," Muir explained.She kicked off her preparations by finishing fifth in a men\'s 3,000m race at the Glasgow Athletics Association Miler Meet on Sunday, claiming the Scottish women\'s 3,000m title in the process.Muir came home in 8:37.21, almost 11 seconds outside her personal best, but was happy with her first competitive outing of the year after some warm-weather training in South Africa."I set a really good pace but it was really good to get out there and get the first race of the season done," she said."I think it sets up a good momentum for the year and this gives you that benchmark you can work on throughout the year."I\'m reasonably happy. You always want to run a wee bit faster. I\'m excited for the next few months."Muir will return to the Emirates Arena for the Scottish Senior Indoor Championships on 28 January, where she has entered the 800m and 1500m.Before that, she will target a fourth straight victory in the 4x1km relay at this Saturday\'s  in Holyrood Park.Later in the year, there is an opportunity to add to her senior medal collection with the (outdoor) European Championships in Berlin from 7-12 August. But in April, Muir - like the rest of us - will watch her compatriots in Commonwealth action in Australia from afar, in between studies and exams. So  does she think might come back from Australia with a medal?\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        "I think all of them are so so strong just now," she added."We saw last year how much has improved. "Andrew Butchart (5,000m) is knocking on the door, Lynsey (Sharp, 800m) as well. Steph (Twell, 5,000m), they\'re all knocking on the door of the Kenyans and depending on how the race is run, I think any of them has a really good chance. "You get the likes of Eilidh (Doyle, 400m hurdles), two silvers (at Glasgow 2014 and Delhi 2010), she always goes out there and runs a great race. And we\'ve got so many good relay runners. "I think we\'ve got so many chances in so many different events."']	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ['"Que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be."Which is all very well if you are on a coach bound for Wembley, but not when it comes to 2018.There are enough uncertainties to the new year, without sport adding to your worries.Fortunately, help is at hand. BBC Sport journalists have grabbed a large pinch of salt with one hand, thrown caution to the wind with the other and can tell you what is in store for the next 12 sporting months. Definitely.Please take this in the spirit it is intended...Manchester City will win an unprecedented Quadruple - beating Manchester United in the Champions League along the way - to leave both Red Devils boss Jose Mourinho and Chelsea counterpart Antonio Conte to ponder \'is it all worth it?\' at the end of the season. Sam Allardyce will be hailed as a hero by those who questioned his appointment as Everton manager by guiding the Toffees into the Europa League, while dozens of players in the Premier League will be linked to either Barcelona or Real Madrid, some on the basis of simply scoring in three successive games.One man who will not move is Tottenham\'s Harry Kane. He will stay and lead the club into the next era at their new stadium on White Hart Lane.England will surprise at the World Cup by not only actually navigating the group stage but by reaching at least the last eight, with manager Gareth Southgate rewarded with a new and improved contract.Oh, and Rangers will appoint a new manager. This is meant to be light-hearted and fun - so don\'t hang it around my neck come December.The Formula 1 season will start with some kind of whizz-bang promotional event masterminded by new owners Liberty Media, whose attempts to spice up the sport will continue to provoke mixed reactions through the year.Lewis Hamilton will win a fifth title but his closest rival will be Red Bull\'s Max Verstappen, not Ferrari\'s Sebastian Vettel.Fernando Alonso is due some luck - it\'s coming up for five years, believe it or not, since he won a grand prix. So that duck will end this year with McLaren-Renault - and he will win Le Mans with Toyota.Ferrari will win some races - but team boss Maurizio Arrivabene will leave/be sacked at the end of the season. This will be Kimi Raikkonen\'s last season in Formula 1 - he will be replaced at Ferrari in 2019 by Charles Leclerc, who is making his debut this season with Sauber.And Daniel Ricciardo will leave Red Bull at the end of the year to become Hamilton\'s new team-mate at Mercedes.That would keep things spicy, wouldn\'t it?The Ashes are gone, but England will show real cricket is played with a white ball, thrashing Australia and New Zealand in limited-overs cricket on both sides of the Tasman.When they pull the whites back on, England\'s problems in Test cricket will be forgotten thanks to a spring in New Zealand, and May home matches against Pakistan - ideal conditions when you have more 84mph right-armers than you know what to do with.Introspection will not be far away, though. After India\'s Virat Kohli conquers England, all will be asking why county cricket cannot produce genius batsmen. Ditto when Joe Root\'s men go to Sri Lanka in the autumn and we bemoan the lack of spinners. In the first standalone Women\'s World T20, to be played in the Caribbean, England will add another trophy to the World Cup won in 2017, and Danielle Wyatt will be named player of the tournament. Ireland will make their bow in Test cricket, with England fans demanding their team play at least three matches in Dublin every year.After breaking Scottish hearts at Murrayfield - yet again - England will be on course for a historic third successive Six Nations title, before a superb Irish performance derails the chariot at Twickenham on the final day. France\'s impersonation of the England football team continues, with the national side limping to a fourth-placed Six Nations finish, while the Top 14 final is played in front of a 200,000 crowd in June. Saracens\' European dominance ends at the quarter-final stage, but the Wolfpack rally to win the Premiership title at Twickenham thanks to a controversial TMO decision, while Leinster seal a Champions Cup and Pro 14 double, with man-of-the-match  in the aftermath. The heavily hyped meeting between England and New Zealand at Twickenham is something of an anti-climax, with the All Blacks winning by two points in torrential rain.Off the field, players and administrators avoid a strike by coming to an agreement on a new season structure, with both parties hailing a "satisfactory compromise", although issues around player welfare continue, and are likely to be resolved in time for the 2032 season.  After a wonderful World Cup in 2017, club owners in both hemispheres will try their very best to ignore the international game in 2018.American promoter Jason Moore wants to stage an England v New Zealand showdown in Denver in June 2018. The players want it, the international federation wants it, the two domestic governing bodies want it. But given it needs the Aussie clubs to agree to a release of their players for the match to take place, don\'t go booking any flights to Colorado just yet. The Aussie clubs normally can\'t see beyond their own back gate, so it\'s less than likely to happen. On the home front there will be a changing of the guard at Red Hall, with RFL chief executive Nigel Wood tipped to stand down. Twitter will rejoice. Then, before the year is out, the keyboard warriors will be demanding the head of Wood\'s replacement.The amateur clubs will light up the early rounds of the Challenge Cup, but come the final we\'ll be asking why it\'s still being played on August bank holiday, when everyone wants it switched to May or June.Magic Weekend in Newcastle in May will be joyful, the Grand Final in October will be spectacular. Then bring on the Kiwis for a three-match series in the autumn - in Hull, Liverpool and Leeds - to underline the importance of the international game. With so much uncertainty surrounding many of the top names, and a younger crop of talent yet to fully convince, the safest bet for 2018 could well be more major titles for Roger Federer and Serena Williams. With doubts surrounding the fitness of Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka and now Rafael Nadal - who has pulled out a planned season-opener in Abu Dhabi - there is every reason to think Federer can add to his 19 Grand Slam titles.In the women\'s game, 2017 saw real signs of new talent finally challenging the old order, none more so than Jelena Ostapenko\'s breathtaking barrage of winners on her way to French Open victory.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        In the absence of Williams, leading contenders Simona Halep, Garbine Muguruza and Karolina Pliskova never quite fully convinced, however, as the next leading light of the WTA.However, Halep may well add a Grand Slam title to her number one status, with the French Open hers for the taking one day as the pre-eminent clay-courter.And, once her custody situation is hopefully happily resolved, there is no reason to think Victoria Azarenka cannot rival the current contenders for the big titles. This is the year when golf speeds up. In June, the European Tour stages the Shot Clock Masters in Austria with the idea of banishing the blight of slow play. A ground-breaking tournament, competitors will be allowed only 40 seconds per stroke or face shot penalties for going over their allotted time. It is no gimmick and the event counts on the Race to Dubai and in Ryder Cup qualifying.If successful, it could prove a blueprint to help the game become more attractive to watch and play.There is no time to be wasted for Tiger Woods trying to make up for so long out injured, while Rory McIlroy will want to avoid a fourth successive year without a major win.The US are overwhelming favourites to retain the Ryder Cup but Europe like it that way, so expect a classic contest at Le Golf National in September.Wolverhampton\'s Aaron Rai is one to watch on the European Tour, and expect Jordan Smith to continue climbing the rankings.There will be resurgent years for Bubba Watson, Adam Scott and Victor Dubuisson. Australia\'s Marc Leishman will break his major duck, and Ireland\'s Paul Dunne will challenge hard for a Ryder Cup spot.Dorset\'s Georgia Hall will not waste qualifying for the LPGA Tour. Her presence there might hurry up fellow Englishwoman Charley Hull and accelerate the process of fulfilling her vast potential.As I say, in 2018 speed is of the essence. Once described as a "lawless state" by a judge in New York, boxing has no fixed calendar so looking ahead to any new year is largely a case of peering into the unknown.   Anthony Joshua, whose only defeat so far came against Mo Farah in Liverpool, has to beat Joseph Parker to set up a showdown against Deontay Wilder later in the year - a contest George Foreman has Even bigger, in the UK, will be Joshua versus Tyson Fury but probably not until 2019. The \'Gypsy King\' will be given his licence back in the next few weeks and is likely to fight at least twice before guiding the crosshairs onto Joshua. Should Fury opt to showcase his immense talent on BT Sport, his decision will intensify an important broadcasting rivalry as Frank Warren leads the charge against Eddie Hearn and Sky Sports.We travel only seven weeks into 2018 to savour George Groves taking on Chris Eubank Jr in the semi-finals of the World Boxing Super Series.  The Series has been a revelation, at cruiserweight and super-middleweight, but it is a business model as well as a fans\' dream and a renewal in other weight divisions is no certainty.Top of my wish-list in 2018 is for Amir Khan to dust off the spiders and face Kell Brook. It\'s long overdue and both are past their best but such conditions have led to classics in the past. It may not seem terribly likely to his opponents, but the practically all-conquering Aidan O\'Brien does actually go back to zero successes on 1 January.And, obviously only whisper it at this stage, there\'s a chance the pride of County Tipperary could find the going heavy as he seeks to build on record-breaking flat-racing achievements in 2017.Appearing over the horizon is \'General\' John Gosden, with trusty lieutenant Frankie Dettori at his side, and a pretty impressive equine army behind them.   Prix de l\'Arc de Triomphe-winning filly Enable and the brilliant colt Cracksman are both being aimed at the 2018 Arc - if both make it, Dettori\'s undoubted diplomatic skills will be tested, as he\'s forced to reject one in favour of the other. Over jumps, hopefully all of the winners of last season\'s \'big four\' races at the Cheltenham Festival will defend their titles - last time none returned, and we felt robbed. Sizing John, hero of the centrepiece Gold Cup, has the potential to be an outstanding, multiple winner.But be warned - we\'ve said that about a whole lot of winners before, and only five horses have done it twice or more since World War Two.Name them. Go on. Yes, Cottage Rake, Arkle, L\'Escargot, Best Mate and, of course, Kauto Star. And then there were six? Quite possibly. Gold Cup day is 16 March.The King is gone. Long live, well, who exactly?With Usain Bolt enjoying his well-earned retirement, athletics has lost its brightest and only bona-fide crossover star.The next generation is there. The brilliant Belgian Nafissatou Thiam is an world and Olympic champion while still hacking her way through a geography degree, South African Wayde van Niekerk will pull in fans with his Johnsonesque talent and easy charm, but watch out for Mutaz Essa Barshim.The spring-heeled Qatari will hit the biggest landmark of the year, toppling the 24-year-old high jump world record set by Cuban great Javier Sotomayor and cementing himself as the figurehead of the 2019 World Championships in Doha.On the domestic scene, the London Marathon\'s top-class field will swallow up Mo Farah on  as the four-time Olympic champion, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing, awaits the result of a US Anti-Doping Agency investigation into former coach Alberto Salazar. In Farah\'s wake, Dina Asher-Smith, still just 22, finally gets an injury-free run and comes a narrow second to Netherlands\' Dafne Schippers in European 100m final in August, while the youthful rivalry between Jake Wightman, Charlie Grice and Josh Kerr pushes all three into contention for the 1500m crown.With neither a World Championships nor an Olympics in 2018, expect the IAAF to take advantage of a relatively fallow year to sharpen up the sport\'s commercial edge.As well as the introduction of world rankings and more street-level showpieces, such as those in Zurich\'s main station and the Great CityGames, each Diamond League host city will be assigned a multi-national \'team\' of athletes to support at other meetings throughout the season.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

She came up against a determined Svitolina, who controlled the match throughout.The 23-year-old sent down 10 aces and never faced a break point on the way to a 10th career title.Halep's match against Siniakova was moved indoors because of rain, and the Romanian started strongly, winning the first set without facing a break point.She appeared to lose focus in the second set but regained her composure in the decider to break her Czech opponent's serve three times and seal her first tournament win since May's Madrid Open.Meanwhile, top seed  won two matches in just over four hours to set up a final against second seed  at the Auckland Classic.The schedule had been affected by rain, forcing organisers to play the quarter-finals and both semi-finals on Saturday and move the final to Sunday.Denmark's Wozniacki got the better of 19-year-old American wildcard Sofia Kenin 4-6 6-2 6-4 before defeating US qualifier Sachia Vickery 6-4 6-4.Vickery had earlier upset third seed Agnieszka Radwanska.Goerges, who had lost to American Sloane Stephens in the 2016 Auckland final, was far more comfortable in both of her matches.She beat Slovenia's Polona Hercog 6-4 6-4 in the quarter-finals before moving into the final with a 6-1 6-4 win over Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei.Elsewhere, Britain's Heather Watson made a winning start in qualifying for the Hobart International, beating Australia's Kimberly Birrell 6-3 6-2.Watson will next face Japan's Nao Hibino, who at 97 is ranked 22 places below her."]	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['Britain\'s Andy Murray has had hip surgery in Melbourne and says he hopes to be playing again in time for this summer\'s grass-court season.The former world number one, 30, has not played a competitive match since he was knocked out of Wimbledon in July.The ongoing problem forced the Scot to  which begins on 15 January."I\'m not finished playing tennis yet. I\'m going to be competing at the highest level again," he said."I\'m very optimistic about the future - the surgeon is very happy about how it went."Murray, a three-time Grand Slam champion, believes if he can return to 95% of his best, that will be enough for him to compete again at the top level.He hopes he will be hitting balls on court again after seven or eight weeks, and has been given 14 weeks as a guide for a return from this kind of surgery. But Murray, who has fallen to 19th in the world, said he is not "interested in coming back for a specific tournament"."My plan is to be back playing around the grass-court season - potentially before then - but I\'m certainly not going to rush anything," said Murray, speaking from his hospital bed in a telephone conference  call to a group of British journalists."I want to know when I come back that I\'m ready."He was operated on by Dr John O\'Donnell at the St Vincent Hospital in Melbourne on Monday.Murray posted a photo from hospital  and said: "Feeling really positive and looking forward to starting rehab."\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Murray withdrew from the US Open two days before the start of the tournament in August last year, and said he realised he was not ready to compete in Brisbane last week when he tested his hip against other top-50 players."I want to come back when I\'m fit and ready to play, not to get into a situation like in Brisbane or New York, where I\'m unsure when I turn up at a tournament how fit I am," he said.Murray has not played a competitive match since his Wimbledon quarter-final defeat by Sam Querrey on 12 July.He said he first felt pain in his right hip during June\'s French Open semi-final against Stan Wawrinka, though he has had issues with it throughout his career."The surgeon felt that my hip will be feeling better than it did a year ago," Murray said. "Obviously, I was still doing fine a year ago - I was ranked number one in the world."I\'m certainly not going to be putting in the same amount of tournaments and effort to try to get to number one in the world. I\'ll be playing a reduced schedule, and then focusing more on trying to win major events and big tournaments rather than trying to achieve certain ranking goals."I\'ve been fairly competitive with top-50 players in the world in Brisbane when I\'m struggling to move, and I made the quarter-finals at Wimbledon when I literally couldn\'t walk and was in so much pain."So if I can get myself to 95% of my best, I believe that\'s enough to compete at the highest level. No question."The rest of my body feels fantastic. I feel really, really good physically apart from this one issue. The surgery allows me to extend my hip well, and I\'ll be able to sprint." Murray said it has been painful for him to walk since before Wimbledon. Though he has become accustomed to soreness in his hip, the pain he has had since last summer has had an impact on his day-to-day life.It has also emerged that he had minor groin surgery on 18 December. That was successful in relieving some of the pain he had been experiencing, and was the reason for delaying his departure to Australia until after Christmas.Should Murray\'s rehabilitation go to plan, he will have been out of action for almost a year by the time he returns.And he says he would like to play until eldest daughter Sophia, who was born in February 2016, is able to watch him and have "a small understanding of what it is I\'ve done for my living"."That would be cool if she can come along and watch me hit some balls or practise just to see what it is I do," he added. "I like watching and seeing a lot of the other kids when they are on the tour with their parents."']	 CATEGORY:Sports

The 27-year-old Dane last held top spot six years ago and the current record for the longest gap between being ranked number one is held by Serena Williams, who spent five years and 29 days off the top spot between 10 August 2003 and 8 September 2008. Gorges, who was runner-up in Auckland to US Open champion Sloane Stephens in 2016, had been victorious at last October's Kremlin Cup in Moscow and the WTA Elite Trophy the following month in Zhuhai,She won the first set against Wozniacki with her seventh ace, having broken serve in the first game.She broke again in the first game of the second set, before the world number three fought back to force a tie-break, but another Goerges forehand winner sealed the victory.Elsewhere on the tour, British number two  came through an early scare in her second qualifying match to reach the main draw at the Hobart International.Despite dropping the first set, she fought back to beat Japan's Nao Hibino 4-6 7-5 6-3, and will face Romania's Sorana Cirstea in the first round of a tournament she won in 2015."]	 CATEGORY:Sports

A change in International Tennis Federation rules had prevented him representing Britain in either the Olympics He describes his time in British colours as a "great journey, with a bad ending"."It wasn\'t because I didn\'t like Britain, because I really wanted to play for Great Britain," he told BBC Sport as he spoke about his decision for the first time."At the end of the day, it wasn\'t my decision. It was the ITF\'s decision. It was tough, but what I did was right. I did everything that I could. It\'s a sad story at the end, but it\'s a new beginning."Bedene says he does not feel uncomfortable to have sworn an oath of allegiance to his adopted country. And he denies he became a British citizen just to further his Davis Cup and Olympic ambitions."No, the main reason was I felt I wanted to give something back to the country that gave to me," he adds. "I was living there, and I felt like I was living there for longer than really I was."And I was a bit sad, but I had to decide at the end as it wasn\'t healthy for me.

I\'m happy again with the different kind of players that I\'ve played so I feel good going into Melbourne - as good as I can feel."Konta is set to be seeded 10th for the opening Grand Slam of 2018, which begins on 15 January.Neither she nor former world number two Radwanska were able to dominate with their serve in the first set, with Konta in particular struggling on her second serve as her Polish opponent converted three of her five break opportunities.Konta again had trouble holding serve in the second set but showed signs of a fightback when she broke while trailing 4-1 in the second, but was unable to build as Radwanska sealed victory in one hour and 49 minutes.Radwanska, now down to 28th in the world having been hampered by injury last year, will face American qualifier Catherine Bellis in the second round.Also through to the second round is who came from a set down beat second seed Venus Williams 5-7 6-3 6-1.Former world number one Kerber is now ranked 22nd after a disappointing run of form in 2017 but she showed signs of resurgence against the American.Williams, who was playing in the Sydney tournament for the first time since 1999, finished the first set strongly, coming from 5-3 down to win four consecutive games.But, playing in her first match of the season, her accuracy deserted her at times in the second set and Kerber capitalised and went on to show her strength in the decider.Konta made a bright start - moving, bending and stretching well - but lost her way against the crafty 2012 Wimbledon finalist. It was a horrid first-round draw. Radwanska\'s stout defence and lack of pace caused many problems for Konta, who missed far too frequently from the baseline. The Pole won seven games in a row at one stage, and had a double-break advantage in the second set. Konta rallied well, but could not quite extend the match into a decider.There will be a subsequent loss of ranking points for Konta, but of greater importance was the speed of her recovery from the hip injury.']	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ["Less than a week after eloquently describing on social media how demoralising it is to be deprived of the sport he so loves, Andy Murray spoke confidently of being able to compete at the highest level once more.Surgery on his troublesome right hip had taken place just 12 hours earlier: a hip which has prevented him playing a match in anger  and left him in regular pain even when walking.His surgeon has told him the remodelled hip will feel better than it did a year ago, and it has not escaped Murray's attention that a year ago he was the world number one. He is very unlikely to top the rankings again, but Murray clearly believes he can be a significant figure in the second week of Grand Slams in future. He is not returning just to complete one richly deserved lap of honour.Whether he can do so remains to be seen. It would be foolish to predict exactly how his body will recover, and then respond when he returns to the tour. But he will be determined and diligent over the months to come, and that can only be a force for good.Rehabilitation, rather than surgery, was considered the best course of action last July. To his huge frustration, Murray still found himself at base camp six months later. The 30-year-old has tacitly admitted he should not have tried to return in time for the start of the US Open last August. Other than the three-week break he took after his aborted attempt to play in the year's final Grand Slam, Murray says he has been practising virtually every day. Would a three-month break have averted the need for surgery? His love for the sport, and drive for self-improvement, has often made it difficult for him to leave his racquet and balls alone.That debate is now academic. Murray plans to be playing again by the grass-court season, perhaps even a little earlier. He will reduce his schedule, but not to the detriment of his Grand Slam chances.He probably would not wish to skip an entire clay-court season as Roger Federer did last year. For the sake of his rhythm, and given the opportunity, he is likely to want to play more than the 12 tournaments Federer did in 2017. The two have totally different game styles and totally different bodies, but the Swiss - and Serena Williams - have at least proved you can have astonishing success on a much-reduced diet.A major worry for Murray is that, even in a best-case scenario, he will be away from the tour for virtually a year. That is a very long period of time for a man who may aspire to play top-five tennis again. When Murray had in September 2013, he was absent for just three and a half months, and yet not back to his best for more than a year.If he returns on the grass, he will do so at the age of 31 and with a ranking of around 150. A protected ranking will afford him direct entry into all the main events, but not a seeding, and so he will find himself at the mercy of the draw.These, though, are worries for another day. Murray accepts it is only fair to question his ability to compete once more at the highest level. But if this surgery gives his career a new lease of life, then everyone in tennis should cheer."]	 CATEGORY:Sports

The FA plans to use VAR in each round of the FA Cup, while it is also being trialled in Wednesday\'s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg between Chelsea and Arsenal, plus the return leg two weeks\' later.  Football Association chief executive Martin Glenn is confident the VAR system will soon become a permanent fixture in English football."We were a big supporter of VAR being embraced in football after years of it being challenged by Sepp Blatter and Fifa", Glenn said on Tuesday."The FA generally thinks that in a few years\' time we will wonder how we ever lived without it."I was pleased as it seemed to work the right way. The good news is that the game didn\'t stop once and there appeared to be good teamwork between [referee] Andre Marriner and [VAR] Neil Swarbrick."The big question now is: should we put it into the World Cup?"The biggest confusion about Glenn Murray\'s winning goal in Brighton\'s FA Cup win over Palace was more to do with whether the VAR was used, rather than whether the decision was right. The short answer was that the system was used - to a point. Referee Andre Marriner was engaged in conversation with his VAR Neil Swarbrick most of the evening and it is understood they consulted on about 11 decisions throughout the game.But because there was no clear and obvious error made by Marriner the review system, where the referee makes the TV signal, did not come into force. Marriner had the assistance of Swarbrick watching the game on television in the Premier League\'s west London studio, with between 12 and 15 camera angles - plus four cameras in each goal - helping him along the way.As the Murray goal showed, just because you can replay an incident on a screen, it does not make the decision beyond debate.As International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray says, the system is designed to "deal with the big mistakes, those big unseen incidents, which bring big unfairness".Marriner believed that Murray scored with his knee, the VAR agreed and the decision stood.Opponents of VAR suggest it will upset the flow of the game, but its first test in English football showed it can still be used without disrupting the match. Where a review is used, it will normally be triggered during stoppages in play and limited to four types of match-changing incidents:So, for example, if Murray had clearly scored with his hand and Marriner had not spotted it, the VAR would contact him via an audio link and tell him to reverse that decision as soon as possible."What the referee doesn\'t have the option of doing is saying is \'I don\'t know if that was a penalty or not, I\'ll look at the replay\'," added Elleray. "We are requiring the referees to carry on refereeing as if there is no video assistant referee. If they make a clear and obvious error, they get told about it and I think most referees will welcome that." VAR can only be used at Premier League stadiums where there is a direct link back to the Premier League studios west of London. That is why Leicester and Fleetwood will be able to use VAR in their replay, but Yeovil Town will not have the same privilege in their fourth-round tie at home to Manchester United.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

Of the 339 goals scored in the Scottish Premiership so far this season, BBC Scotland and some well-known pundits have selected their favourite finishes.One week after beating Rangers at Ibrox, Neil Lennon\'s Hibernian side found themselves on the wrong end of a  at home to Hamilton Academical. The second of Rakish Bingham\'s double was a thing of one-touch passing beauty. Danny Redmond, Louis Longridge and Greg Docherty were all involved in a series of one-twos before Bingham put the icing on the cake to make it 3-0. Former Scotland striker Steven Thompson has chosen this as his goal of the season so far.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        At the end of August, Scott Wright produced another moment of magic at Firhill, having scored a hat-trick at the same venue just three months earlier on the final day of the 2016-17 league season. The 20-year-old curled in the third goal for Aberdeen in an incident-packed  over Partick Thistle. Former Scotland Women\'s number one Gemma Fay said: "As a goalkeeper, when you see these kind of balls coming in, you just know there is nothing you can do about it."\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Having scored six league goals last season for Aberdeen, Ryan Christie rejoined the Dons on loan from Celtic in June. Michael Stewart has selected the midfielder\'s top corner finish  at Pittodrie as his goal of the season so far.Christie currently sits on three goals for the 2017-18 season.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Aberdeen teenager Frank Ross scored his first professional goal in a  at Pittodrie. With shades of James Maddison\'s free-kick winner in the same fixture the previous season, Ross\'s curling effort sailed into the top left corner. Wes Foderingham got his fingertips to the ball but could not keep it out.

CONTENT:  ['\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        The transfer that Liverpool fans hoped would never happen has finally been agreed.Philippe Coutinho is  in one of the most expensive deals ever.But just how much will Liverpool miss him, and where do they need to invest the £142m fee? With the help of former Reds defender Mark Lawrenson and chief football writer Phil McNulty, BBC Sport attempts to answer these questions and more besides, while Spanish football writer Andy West considers just where Coutinho will fit into the current Barcelona squad.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        There is no doubt that Coutinho has been a massive player for Liverpool since arriving in January 2013.He has scored 54 goals in over 200 appearances, hitting double figures in each of the last three seasons. The Brazilian was the club\'s joint top scorer in the Premier League last term with 13 goals and was well on course to surpass that total in the current campaign, leaving Anfield with seven goals.But what Liverpool will miss more than his goals is his ability to create chances for his team-mates and make those around him better.In terms of goals, no player has scored more than Roberto Firmino since he joined the club in the summer of 2015 (30 goals) but without Coutinho alongside him, the Brazilian forward is not as effective.Firmino has scored six goals in the 11 games they have started together this season, but in the seven games he has started without his compatriot, the 26-year-old has managed just three. That\'s a goals per game ratio of 0.54 when they both start compared to 0.42 when just Firmino starts.Indeed, not even former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, who played alongside Coutinho in the early part of the Brazilian\'s career at Anfield, could have envisaged such a rise.Carragher  "Disappointed Coutinho has gone, never thought he\'d turn into the player he\'s become when I first played with him, but he\'s been a great Liverpool player these last few years."Mohamed Salah\'s sensational form this season has no doubt provided a welcome distraction to the Coutinho saga for Liverpool fans.The Egypt international has scored 17 goals in 21 Premier League games since joining in the summer, and his stats certainly stack up well against Coutinho. Salah has scored 10 more goals than Coutinho so far in 2017-18, although the latter provided more assists (six to Salah\'s five) and created more chances overall (40 to 35) in fewer games (14 to 21).But in terms of first-season influence, Salah is having a bigger impact on Liverpool than Coutinho did, as the below table highlights.The departure of such a key figure as Coutinho is, of course, a blow to Liverpool. He has developed into an outstanding player, a maturity illustrated by the increase in his value to £142m after costing Liverpool just £8.5m from Inter Milan in January 2013.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        It is a setback that is cushioned by the stunning impact made by summer signing Salah, not strictly a player in the Coutinho mould but a creator and goalscorer more than capable of carrying a major burden  as Liverpool chase a top-four place, the Champions League and the FA Cup.Salah has illuminated Liverpool with his pace, strength and his astonishing goalscoring, a world away from the younger version who failed to make an impact at Chelsea.Liverpool\'s so-called \'Fab Four\' broke up quickly but Salah, Sadio Mane and Firmino have shown enough to suggest that Coutinho\'s departure, while it cannot be dismissed, can be covered.Midfield enforcement of a different sort will arrive when Naby Keita joins from RB Leipzig in the summer, so manager Jurgen Klopp will have been exploring various options.And what about Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain? He was brought to Anfield on the promise of a central midfield role - maybe he will be given a lengthy period to impress.It is naive in the extreme to suggest Klopp and those behind the scenes at Anfield have not been looking at succession planning to compensate for the loss of Coutinho - but equally, do not expect a spending spree within hours of the money clearing.Liverpool may have an initial £105m in the bank from the sale, but it will not burn a hole in Klopp\'s pocket and he will only spend on who he wants, although the £75m spent on Virgil van Dijk shows he will also spend what it takes.Klopp continues to be linked with Monaco\'s Thomas Lemar but it is likely the list of potential replacements and those who could be brought in with the Coutinho money has already been drawn up.Liverpool\'s recent spending under Klopp may have brought some expensive purchases but it has been a measured and carefully structured approach.And as the long game that led to the signing of Van Dijk proved, Klopp has firm ideas on who he wants and rarely likes to venture into Plan B territory.It is a lot of money and Liverpool have to spend it wisely. They have spent £75m of it wisely on Virgil van Dijk - a player we have needed for some time, a leader at the back - but Coutinho needs replacing and we have to do it ASAP.Leicester\'s Riyad Mahrez has played in the Premier League for some years and everybody has seen the ability he has got, so he ticks a lot of boxes.You need that type of player similar to Coutinho who sees that pass, can do something extraordinary outside the box, can bend it in the top corner and is good on free-kicks as well.Mahrez has been linked, but former Liverpool player Lawrenson believes Alexis Sanchez would be the ideal replacement for Coutinho.Sanchez\'s future at Arsenal appears increasingly uncertain, with Manchester City - who failed in their attempt to sign the Chile international last summer - likely to move again for the forward this month,"There is a fella at Arsenal who wants out called Alexis Sanchez, that would be very interesting if Liverpool decide to go for someone like that," says Lawrenson."If you can get Sanchez, and you have already got Virgil van Dijk, then that is good business, probably good business for everyone."The departure of such an influential player stirs memories of Fernando Torres\' £50m move to Chelsea in 2011 and Barcelona\'s signing of Luis Suarez in 2014.But can Coutinho\'s departure be compared to those? And is the club\'s reaction to previous big-name departures a reason for optimism for Liverpool fans?"[Torres and Suarez] were both very, very good for Liverpool," says Lawrenson, "but when you think of it like that it does soften the blow for it because it is a case of, \'the King is dead, long live the King\'."The loss of Coutinho is a blow but I don\'t think it is insurmountable. It is not like Tottenham losing Harry Kane, is it?"Barcelona have never made a secret of the fact that Coutinho is their number one target to provide more creative flair to their midfield, with the Brazilian earmarked as the long-term replacement for club captain Andres Iniesta, who will be 34 by the end of the season.And the importance of Iniesta explains why Barca have been so determined to complete the deal now, rather than waiting until the summer.With La Liga effectively already won, the Catalan club are now turning their main focus onto regaining the Champions League crown, and Iniesta will be vital to that quest. Even Lionel Messi can\'t do everything by himself, and the presence of a fit and healthy Iniesta will make a major difference in giving Barca the best possible chance of breaking down the continent\'s best defences.The arrival of Coutinho, therefore, means that Iniesta can be safely rested for league games without the team suffering a significant drop-off in quality, allowing the ageing skipper to reserve his energies for the European stage.Tactically, Coutinho\'s biggest challenge will be learning how to combine effectively with Messi and help create space for the Argentine - around whom everything revolves - rather than getting in his way.']	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ['Mark Hughes offered up temptation that fate was unable to resist when recently asked about his position as Stoke City manager, replying: "Who else is going to do it?"The answer will be known soon enough after Hughes was sacked following the humiliating  at League Two Coventry City.Stoke\'s ownership, led by the Coates family, are known for their patience and calm-headed approach to matters such as managerial affairs, but the loss at the Ricoh Arena came with inevitable consequences.So what went wrong for Hughes at Stoke?In the Tony Pulis-era that preceded Hughes\' appointment in  and first three seasons under the 54-year-old, Stoke were notoriously tough opponents at their hostile and atmospheric stadium situated just off the M6.But this season has followed the disturbing pattern that emerged last term, with Stoke\'s core strength of solidity - base camp for the years of progress and consolidation under Pulis - becoming a flaw.Stoke\'s defensive strength has been reduced to rubble under Hughes, with no sign of improvement.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Stoke have conceded 47 goals in 22 league games this term - and history tells us that is the sort of record that invariably ends in relegation. They have the division\'s worst goal difference at -24.Only two sides with such a poor defensive record at this stage of a Premier League season have ever escaped the drop: Swansea, who had conceded 51 goals at the same stage last season, and Wigan (47)  in 2010.Stoke\'s haul of 14 points from 11 home league games this season is also their worst at this stage since they came back to the top flight.The highest total after 11 games was the 20 collected under Pulis in his final season in 2012/13.So while the FA Cup loss may have convinced Stoke to sack Hughes, the real concerns lay in that drop to 18th in the Premier League with five wins and 12 losses from those 22 games.It thus became an inevitable end for Hughes.When Hughes was appointed to succeed Pulis he did so amid talk of a new, easier-on-the-eye style - taking the club to "the next level" became a buzz phrase.This was damning Pulis with faint praise. He had done an excellent job in not only getting Stoke into the Premier League but then stabilising them, but Hughes was determined to bring an exotic touch to the side.But Hughes\' hit rate in the transfer market had become increasingly suspect and was another big factor in his departure. He made 33 permanent signings - many of them ambitious but only a few of them unqualified successes.Bojan Krcic arrived from  but flourished only fleetingly, although in Hughes and the player\'s defence he suffered a huge blow when he damaged his anterior cruciate ligament two years ago.Hughes\' record outlay of £18.3m on midfielder  from Porto in February 2016 was a dismal failure as the player never looked fit for Premier League purpose. He is now on loan and a "Sometimes things just don\'t pan out as you hope," said Hughes, with more than a little understatement, when addressing the subject of Imbula.Xherdan Shaqiri was an unquestioned marquee signing when he joined from  in August 2015. He has produced moments of genuine brilliance but not with the consistency required to lift the increasing gloom.Former Real Madrid forward Jese arrived  in August, but after marking his debut with the winner in the  he has proved to be another blip on Hughes\' transfer record.Jese was disciplined for  early after Hughes made his second and third substitutions in the home win over Swansea in December and his Stoke career already seems over amid talk of a move to Las Palmas.And this summer\'s big outlay, the  for Kevin Wimmer, has been another failure, the centre-back unable to provide the quality required to stop Stoke\'s defence shipping goals.While it is unfair to lay the blame for Hughes\' woes at the feet of one player, the debacle that has been Saido Berahino\'s Stoke career will be regarded as emblematic of the manager\'s final months in charge.Hughes paid  from West Brom in the hope of reviving a career that was once so promising the likes of Tottenham and Liverpool were linked with him.Stoke never quite looked like a Hughes team and never quite escaped the impression they were still largely a Pulis teamYet since joining Stoke in January 2017 Berahino\'s career has simply flatlined.He has played 23 Premier League games with 11 starts in that time, a total of 1,106 minutes, and does not have a goal to his name in any competition. In the Premier League he has only one assist.Berahino started in the FA Cup loss at Coventry but made no impact. Hughes\' gamble on Berahino\'s early potential had backfired. It was another failure.Despite its sorry end, Hughes should not have his four-year reign dismissed as a complete failure.In his first three seasons he did exactly what was demanded of him when he gave Stoke successive ninth-placed Premier League finishes, and served up excitement with the maverick talents of Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic, whose £24m move to West Ham this summer robbed them of unpredictability and goals.He also almost took Stoke to a major final, only to lose on penalties to Liverpool in the League Cup semis in 2016.But the tide turned when Stoke\'s form dipped en route to a 13th-placed finish last season, and further problems this term left Hughes on the precipice before Saturday\'s defeat.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        In recent times he has leaned heavily, perhaps too heavily, on perceived injustices with match officials, and flew in the face of obvious evidence when he suggested he had the experience and personnel to turn Stoke\'s fortunes around.It was not complacency, but Hughes\' confidence that Stoke would turn the corner was not backed up by results or performances.In the final reckoning, he was never fully able to complete what was meant to be a change in identity for Stoke and got caught in between two targets.Stoke never quite looked like a Hughes team and never quite escaped the impression they were still largely a Pulis team.Hughes will never get the chance to complete that transformation - but he still deserves credit for his first three years at the club.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Hughes is now left looking for his next staging post in a managerial career that has also taken in Wales, Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, Fulham and Queen\'s Park Rangers.There have been peaks and troughs in that career, but it is unlikely a man whose quiet exterior masks a fierce passion and determination to succeed is ready to walk away from management at a relatively young age.Hughes may, though, need to drop down a division to rebuild and rehabilitate. It is unlikely he will be offered a swift return to the Premier League.And what about Wales? There is a vacancy after  to take over at Sunderland. Might there be some mutual admiration between Hughes and the FAW?Hughes proved he had the profile and personality for that level during his time as the national team manager, starting in 1999 and only losing out on a place at Euro 2004 after a play-off defeat to Russia.Stoke\'s statement announcing the departure of Hughes contained no reference to a caretaker, suggesting confidence that a new man will be in place by the time they visit Manchester United on 15 January.And it is also naive to suggest Stoke\'s decision-makers would not have at least been weighing up potential options as Hughes struggled in recent weeks.Two candidates have been heavily touted in Derby County\'s Gary Rowett and Republic of Ireland manager Martin O\'Neill.Would 43-year-old Rowett, with Birmingham City still paying the price for their bizarre decision to remove him from his job, consider a move to Stoke having guided Derby into second place in the Championship? Would he swap a promotion push for a relegation fight with all its risks?O\'Neill, at 65, still has hunger for the game and perhaps the hurt he felt at the Republic\'s narrow World Cup qualification failure may persuade him to have another crack at the Premier League.Two of this season\'s early Premier League casualties, ex-Everton boss Ronald Koeman and former West Ham manager Slaven Bilic, have also been mentioned while Fulham\'s Slavisa Jokanovic is an outsider.Whoever emerges from the pack, phase one of their new job will to be make Stoke the imposing environment it used to be for opponents, shore up that defence, and ensure Premier League safety.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        As debuts in English football go, the introduction of a video assistant referee (VAR) during Brighton\'s FA Cup third-round win over Crystal Palace was pretty steady.There were a few complaints from Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson after his side lost thanks to  which the visiting players thought may have been deflected in off the forward\'s arm.But once he\'d calmed down, the veteran manager said it was a "genuine goal" and praised referee Andre Marriner and VAR Neil Swarbrick for coming to the right conclusion in the 2-1 defeat.The biggest confusion seemed to centre around whether VAR was used - and the short answer is: yes it was, to a point.No clear and obvious errors were made by Marriner, meaning the review system - where the two officials take time to look at footage - was not engaged.But they still consulted over the goal - and on 11 decisions overall during the match - to check no mistakes had been made, thereby ensuring the flow of the game remained.In many ways it was the perfect trial, even if it didn\'t stop the Palace players confronting the referee at full-time.Marriner had the assistance of referee Swarbrick watching the game on television in the Premier League\'s west London studio, with between 12 and 15 camera angles - plus four cameras in each goal - helping him along the way.In future, it should cut out mistakes, such as the one referee  in awarding West Brom the late penalty from which they equalised in a 1-1 Premier League draw with Arsenal.But, as the Murray goal showed, just because you can replay an incident on a screen, it does not make the decision beyond debate.As International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray says, the system is designed to "deal with the big mistakes, those big unseen incidents, which bring big unfairness".Marriner thought Murray had scored with his knee, the VAR agreed and the decision stood.Where a VAR review is used, it will normally be triggered during stoppages in play and limited to four types of match-changing incidents:So, for example, if Murray had clearly scored with his hand and Marriner hadn\'t spotted it, the VAR would contact him via an audio link and tell him to reverse that decision as soon as possible."What the referee doesn\'t have the option of doing is saying is \'I don\'t know if that was a penalty or not, I\'ll look at the replay\'," added Elleray. "We are requiring the referees to carry on refereeing as if there is no video assistant referee. If they make a clear and obvious error, they get told about it and I think most referees will welcome that." Unfortunately, VAR can only be used at Premier League stadiums where there is a direct link back to the Premier League studios west of London. It is set to be used in both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final between Chelsea and Arsenal, and the final on 25 February.It will also be implemented in every round of the FA Cup and some replays, based on broadcaster TV picks and whether the host for each tie is in the Premier League. If a review process is engaged, fans will see the referee \'draw\' a rectangle with his arms to replicate a TV screen. Either the referee or the VAR can decide whether an incident needs to be analysed.It will then take one of two forms, with the first likely to be less controversial. If a player has scored a goal from an offside position, for example, the VAR will inform the referee there has been an error which does not require further review. The referee will then make the \'TV screen\' signal and change the original decision.In situations that are less clear, the VAR will advise the referee to look at the video for what is called an \'on-field review\'. This is where the referee will look at the footage on a monitor by the side of the pitch. Following their review, the referee will make a \'TV screen\' signal and communicate the final decision. Fans in the stadium won\'t be able to view replay pictures, but supporters watching at home will see the same camera angles as the referees, so they should at least be able to get an idea of which way the decision is going.It only took 40 minutes of Serie A\'s opening game for VAR technology to be used for the first time when it was introduced at the start of this season in Italy.But since then it has settled down and is now generally used about once in three or four matches, according to former referee Elleray.The technology has also been used in the Bundesliga in Germany and the MLS in the United States and was also available for England\'s two goalless friendlies with Germany and Brazil last November, which passed without incident.Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri has expressed concern over delays caused by VAR referrals, complaining the game was "turning into baseball". And according to German magazine Kicker,  in the Bundesliga. As for those claiming it hands an unfair advantage to teams who benefit from its use, the FA says it is a level playing field for both teams, whether the technology is available or not, and point to the fact that a VAR review is not often used. During the game, players risk a booking if they attempt to influence any official into using VAR, and managers or other non-playing club staff risk being sent to the stand if they do the same, or encroach on the area where the referee is reviewing footage.Should a controversial decision sway a big game, it will be interesting to see how much that rule is enforced.

CONTENT:  ["The January transfer window is now open and some of the top players in Europe are being linked with moves.Barcelona have already completed the But who else could be on the move from Europe's top leagues?As part of the BBC's  European football experts Mina Rzouki, James Horncastle, Raphael Honigstein and Julien Laurens discuss.I really like Emre Can. I think he has really improved over the last 18 months or so. I think he has benefitted from playing in a regular position. Potentially, centre back might actually be his ideal position, although that's one of the reasons he left Bayern Munich - because he said he wanted to play midfield. I think he still needs to improve his decision making I think he needs to time his runs better. He has this tremendous energy and likes to break from deep and of course the comparisons with Juve midfielder Sami Khedira are inevitable - they look a little bit similar as well. He could thrive in this Juventus midfield, especially if they play a classic three-central-midfield game and he can take turns in holding and running. He would be a great signing, especially on a free.For all Liverpool fans it is a given that he is going to come and replace Coutinho as early as this month. Right now Monaco have received no offers from Liverpool or Arsenal, or anyone else. In the summer he was definitely closer to joining Arsenal than Liverpool. But as much as I would love him to go to Liverpool because he would suit this team perfectly - he can play in different positions; he is so good on set pieces; his left foot is amazing - I think Klopp would make him even more world class than he already is. Monaco are the boss when it comes to selling players - when to sell their players, how to sell their players and at which price. It makes no sense whatsoever to let Lemar go now six months before the World Cup, which he could potentially win with France and be a star. It's going to be interesting because he hasn't had a very good season so far compared to what we have been used to before. He was very close to leaving in the summer but stayed being loyal to the club because they couldn't sign anyone to play before January. Now it looks maybe like Barcelona will be his favourite destination, although I do not know if they will have the 100m euro to pay his release fee. His friend Paul Pogba is very keen for him to join Manchetser United so that remains a very credible option for him. There is also Real Madrid who at some point will have to buy a big name star. However, if he does not improve or have a good World Cup then some clubs will be put off. The release clause is quite affordable to most top clubs but his wages are very high. The next six months are going to be huge for him.A transfer is not possible in January. There has been a lot of speculation about what's behind the dip in form that Dybala has had for the last couple of months. Former Juve midfielder Pavel Nedved came out at the Champions League draw recently and said he needs to get his private life in order. That put in to question his professionalism, although I don't think that was the target of Nedved's criticism. I think it is more that Dybala has left his agent, who he has had for a long time, and trusted his affairs to his older brother. I think that has not gone down particularly well at Juve. They don't know who to speak to. There is this idea that the change of agent has caused some instability which no-one is particularly comfortable with. But Juventus have said they have a long-term project for Dybala. They have given him the number 10 shirt and he is the closest thing they have had to Alessandro del Piero since he retired. Juve said to him in the summer that they wanted him to be their Neymar - they wanted him to be their star. We all know what Juventus are like. No one is indispensable to them. They will consider the right offer but Dybala is possibly the exception to that. Juve want him to become the face of the club for years to come. He is not only the best talent but also the most marketable player in Serie A.I think the player that Bayern want to off-load is Arturo Vidal. I think it's an open secret that Bayern think that his attitude, tactical indiscipline and injury problems - although he hasn't missed many games because he's been managed well - are a concern. If there was an offer for him then Bayern would be very happy to entertain it - but not now. Manager Jupp Heynckes has categorically ruled out letting anyone go in January but in the summer I think they would be happy to listen to any offers.He is doing really well at Nice. He has that unofficial 40m euro release clause in his contract. Barca came in for him last summer at 40m euro but they moved the goalposts and said 50m euro. That's the only reason he didn't end up at Barcelona. You have to feel for the guy. He cried, he actually properly physically cried, because the move didn't happen. Now he is not having such a great season with Nice. He is still very talented but he was so heartbroken he has not shone as much as he would have. It looks like Everton are leading the race. But when you are so close to Barcelona I don't think it's the greatest feeling to be linked with Everton. But he wants to leave and they might let him go for the right price. I still think he is a very good player and he would be a great addition to this Everton team but he could do better.He has said that he renewed his contract at Bayern when he was injured and he really respected the club for that and said he was really happy there. I think with Coutinho going to Barca that would suggest to me that Thiago doesn't have a natural space at the Spanish club. The transfer is not something I've seen taken seriously there at the moment. At Bayern, manager Jupp Heynckes has a great relationship with all of his players. He's like a kind uncle. What has possibly been misunderstood is that Thiago is one of the few who had a good relationship with (previous manager) Carlo Ancelotti. But to take that and say that he has fallen out with Heynckes is incorrect."]	 CATEGORY:Sports

A great goalkeeper, a great member of the Liverpool family and a wonderful human being. He will be missed."Former Reds boss  who was a player during Lawrence\'s time at the club, told the Liverpool website: "He actually worked it out for himself that if we were going to push further up the pitch and close people down. Tommy was alive and alert to that."He was a guy who was so humble and he didn\'t think of himself as better than anybody else. Tommy never thought about himself and he was just a really happy-go-lucky lad, and that\'s the way I will remember him."We will all miss him. I just hope people realise just what a great servant he was to Liverpool for many years and what a great guy he was."Goalkeepers who played for the Anfield club and Merseyside rivals Everton also paid their respects.Former England number one  said: "A gentleman who I had the privilege of training with. I learnt so much about being a sweeper-keeper from him."And ex-Everton keeper tweeted: "RIP the brilliant goalkeeper. Tommy Lawrence." who was a centre-back at Liverpool between 1971 and 1984, said Lawrence was one of his "heroes", adding: "You were a trailblazer for our club, a true gentleman."And ex-Reds and England strikersaid Lawrence "was of the original Shankly greats".Tommy Lawrence was one of the Scottish cornerstones of Bill Shankly\'s great Liverpool side of the 1960s that established the platform and the template for the Anfield successes that followed.Signed by Shankly\'s predecessor Phil Taylor, Lawrence was part of the great spine of Liverpool\'s side from north of the border along with captain Ron Yeats and striker Ian St John.A bulky figure, he was still remarkably agile and reliable and was one of the first to operate as what is these days described as a "sweeper keeper."Lawrence was one of the great characters of a golden era on Merseyside as Liverpool, led by the extrovert Shankly, battled for supremacy against Everton, led by the secretive, media-shy Harry Catterick.The Scot helped Liverpool win the FA Cup against Leeds at Wembley and also two league titles, as well as losing a European Cup Winners\' Cup Final to Borussia Dortmund at Hampden Park in 1966.Lawrence played 390 times for Liverpool between 1962 and 1971 and remained unchallenged as Liverpool\'s first-choice keeper until the emergence of future great Ray Clemence.He may have continued his career across the Mersey at Tranmere but this popular and humble man will always be best remembered as one of Liverpool\'s legendary figures.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

I am still an addict."Fortunately for Palace, Hodgson\'s addiction has seen him conduct a quiet, confident reconstruction of a team stranded with no Premier League points or goals after seven games into the relative comfort of 14th position with 22 points after 18 league games.So how has Hodgson lifted the Eagles off the ground? who was sacked after four league defeats and no goals, on 12 September, the 70-year-old used his tried and trusted methods to reinvigorate a Palace team in danger of being cut adrift at the bottom of the table.Hodgson may now be a footballing elder statesman, but anyone witnessing the training sessions he put on with England at close quarters will vouch for his hands-on approach. It is his voice and methods that count.And that involves constant repetitions of the drills he believes get results - even if it may meet with initial displeasure of the players under his control.Mark Schwarzer, the Australian goalkeeper in Hodgson\'s Fulham side that remarkably reached the  only to lose to Atletico Madrid, acts as witness for this approach and its success.He told BBC Sport: "I remember the first two or three months at Fulham, a lot of the players were coming in pulling their hair out. They were disappointed, they weren\'t happy about the sessions - but the results started coming and very quickly, when you draw and win games to get results, there is nothing better than that."Once you get that you start to execute the plan even at a high level and a more entertaining level and you\'re getting results. That is the key - you build momentum and confidence."It\'s his authority, his confidence, his assurance that he knows what he\'s doing. He carries that confidence across in his coaching and his instructions and in his sessions."Every session is organised to drill you into playing a certain way of football. Every player knows exactly what position they need to take when they have possession of the ball. Every player knows they have an outlet."And if they do not put the plan in place, Hodgson will work on Palace\'s Beckenham training ground until they do.Such is Hodgson\'s focus that often even light-hearted games at the end of sessions do not always meet with his approval.Schwarzer recalls: "Players used to moan all the time, because players are very good at moaning, about wanting to play five-a-side games at the end of sessions but Roy was very reluctant to do it because we worked so hard every day on tactics, on a system."It was always someone like his long-time assistant Ray Lewington or Mike Kelly that used to convince Roy to let us have a game and more times than not he would say: \'You get on with it, I\'m going inside now.\'"Schwarzer is keen to stress there was plenty of enjoyment under Hodgson but added: "He wanted to be focused on that serious stuff but I must make it very clear there was humour, we\'d enjoy it. At the beginning it was tough,  but once the players start to adapt to it, start to understand, then the enjoyment comes out because you\'re having success."I\'ve spoken to one of the guys at Palace and he said the difference in the atmosphere is remarkable compared to what it was like before Roy got there."Former Fulham defender Brede Hangeland, who also worked with Hodgson, agrees and told BBC Sport: "My question was would he get everyone on board with his message because he is quite demanding and old school in many ways?"Not only has he done so well, he has done it quickly. That\'s a surprise to me because in the past whenever he has come to a new club it has taken some time for him before you see improvement in performances and results. At Palace it has been almost instantaneous."When De Boer was dismissed, it was clear Palace\'s players were struggling to adjust to a dramatic change in style from the Dutchman\'s patient passing approach after the aggressive - and successful - style of his predecessor Sam Allardyce. There were also difficulties with De Boer\'s methods and communication problems with his squad.Hodgson has restored order but has applied a combination of the two styles with great success.In his four games, De Boer had an 18.73% long pass ratio while Hodgson\'s is 17.03%. Hodgson\'s average possession per game is 43.15% compared to his predecessor\'s 49.98%.The meticulous, disciplined drilling approach on the training ground has reaped a rich reward.Hodgson may have started his reign with three defeats without a goal, including successive 5-0 and 4-0 losses at Manchester United and Manchester City, but once that first 2-1 win was achieved over champions Chelsea at Selhurst Park on 14 October, he has made his mark.He is no stranger to the Premier League salvage operation, so Palace would have held no terrors despite their parlous position on arrival. When he was appointed at Fulham in December 2007 they were 19th, two points off safety and survived in 17th place.Hangeland\'s revelation that Hodgson\'s approach took time to take effect at Fulham is illustrated by survival only being ensured by winning four of their last five games, including a 3-2 win over Manchester City after trailing 2-0 at half-time when defeat would effectively have meant relegation. It was still a miraculous piece of escape management.Hodgson\'s actual win percentage of 27.8% after 18 leagues may be slightly less than that over the same period when he took over at Fulham and West Brom (33.3%) - but the effect has been hugely positive.It took Palace 731 minutes to score a league goal this season, but now they look solid in defence, stable in midfield and have a potent attack based around the mercurial talent of Wilfried Zaha.Hodgson may still have only five wins from his 18 league matches in charge, and the FA Cup exit to Brighton & Hove Albion was disappointing - but the more significant statistic, and one that points to his stabilising effect, is only one defeat in their past 11 league games.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        And Schwarzer can see his stamp all over the revival, saying: "Palace have got some very talented players and they have brought in a manager who knows the league, knows the game inside out. The players have obviously taken it on board and responded really well to it."I can see it every game from the minute he took over. You could see what he was trying to do with them from the off - shore up the defence, make it difficult to play in between the lines, showing players inside back into this defenders, players are shuffling across."They\'re organised. They\'re creating traps all over the pitch. They are making it very difficult for teams to play around them and through them. They have the Roy Hodgson trademark."They are not conceding as many goals and when they are under pressure they have outlets. They know where to play the ball because they know team-mates will be making runs into those positions because that is the way they work, the way they drill every day in training. It is the result of hours of work with Roy and his team on the training ground."Wilfried Zaha\'s return from injury has been crucial for them, but it\'s Roy\'s management skills and his organisational skills on and off the pitch, together with Ray Lewington and the rest of his coaching staff, that has been absolutely vital to their success and their turnaround."Roy is very good at reminding players of the basics. He will be teaching those players. They will be learning something. People can get a little bit distracted. Sometimes you have to go back to basics and that is what he does."\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Hodgson\'s image is of the conservative coach whose strategy is more safety first than flamboyant and there is no doubt his reputation took a severe knock not just with England but also with Liverpool, where he was sacked in January 2011 after winning only seven of 20 league games and with them in 12th position.He has retained faith in his methods - but he has proved his adaptability at Palace as he utilises the unpredictable and talented Zaha to give his side edge.De Boer\'s ill-fated time at Selhurst Park was symbolised by the loss of Zaha to a knee injury after the season\'s opening game, a 3-0 loss to newly promoted Huddersfield Town, while his return coincided with the winning goal in that crucial win over Chelsea.And while a succession of teams have leant on the ropes almost waiting to lose against runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City, Hodgson took the positive approach at Selhurst Park on New Year\'s Eve and  with only an injury-time penalty save by Ederson denying Palace victory.Palace still became only the second team after Everton to take points off City this season and Hangeland says Hodgson set an example for the rest of the league on how to tackle Pep Guardiola\'s side."Roy more or less gave the rest of the Premier League a lesson on how you can beat City because many have tried, many better on paper than Palace, and failed every time," he said."That was down to the way Roy set them up. They used a relatively low [deep] block but not too low because then you end up camped in your own box and then a quick diagonal counter where Zaha and Andros Townsend are the perfect players to have. It showed the tactical mind which sets him apart from many other managers."And while Hodgson\'s base camp is organisation and tactical discipline, he has demonstrated with his use of the likes of Zaha that he is willing to incorporate individual flair.Schwarzer said: "If you put the hard yards in, you are open to listening to change, to taking on instructions, playing to a game plan, then that is what he requires - but he wants that individual talent, the spark to shine through as well."It\'s not like you are coached to the letter of how he wants you to play. He has a set system, a framework that builds confidence but he has those flair players."We had it at Fulham with Clint Dempsey, Bobby Zamora, Simon Davies, Andrew Johnson and Damien Duff. We had a system, that framework but when we got into areas where those guys could use individual flair he wants to use that and he has it now at Crystal Palace with someone like Zaha."Hodgson was in despair when his England reign ended in failure - but the lure of a Premier League job, no matter how perilous Palace\'s position, was always going to be too much to resist.Schwarzer said: "England is a very tough job. We\'ve seen bigger names than Roy come unstuck with the England national team. He\'s shown at international level he can succeed with the likes of Switzerland. I don\'t think necessarily he is just suited for club football."You see the best of Roy Hodgson when you see him working day to day on the training field with players and that is something you can\'t do with the national team."I had the benefit of catching up with him about 12 months ago. We had dinner with him and a couple of ex-team-mates and we had a really good discussion - all things football of course - about his time with Fulham, Liverpool, West Brom, England and everything else. You could see on that evening he was very determined to come back and give it another go."The guy has got an incredible amount of knowledge of the game and enthusiasm at the ripe young age of 70. It would have been a great shame had he not come back and had another opportunity to prove his critics wrong. I\'ve got the utmost respect for him."And his former Fulham old boy is confident Palace, and their Premier League status, are now in safe hands."I said from the day he was appointed it was a masterstroke on Crystal Palace\'s behalf," says Schwarzer."He\'s perfect for them. He is a perfect fit and I\'m sure - although they are by no means out of danger - Roy and Crystal Palace will build a bigger gap between themselves and the bottom three."']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku is to seek legal advice over claims made by Everton owner Farhad Moshiri that he opted to leave the club after receiving a "voodoo message".Moshiri told a shareholders\' meeting that Lukaku, 24, received the message from "a pilgrimage to Africa".Lukaku joined United  after rejecting a new deal at Everton.A representative for the player told BBC Sport: "Romelu\'s decision had nothing to do with voodoo."The spokesperson added: "He distances himself from these beliefs and this statement and will now see what judicial steps can be taken in relation to them."BBC Sport understands the Belgian has been left upset and angry by the claims. His representative says Lukaku rejected the opportunity to become the highest paid player in Everton\'s history in order to pursue his desire to play at the highest possible level.His representative added: "Romelu is very catholic and voodoo is not part of his life or his beliefs."He simply had no faith in Everton and no confidence in Mr Moshiri\'s project. That is why he did not want to sign on any condition."He wanted to make the next step in his career and wanted the security to be able to leave."Last March Lukaku\'s agent, Mino Raiola, had claimed a new deal to remain at Everton was "99.9% done".Premier League champions Chelsea  but he then opted instead to join Jose Mourinho\'s United."We offered him a better deal than Chelsea and his agent came to Finch Farm to sign the contract," Moshiri told Everton\'s annual general meeting."Robert [Elstone, chief executive] was there, everything was in place, there were a few reporters outside," he added.Moshiri said Lukaku then "called his mother" before the player revealed he had received the message telling him to join Chelsea.The Iranian billionaire, who has put £150m of his own money into the Merseyside club to clear debts, said the Toffees offered the striker an "unbelievable" amount of money to stay and the "issue was not financial".Moshiri added: "I wasted two summers to keep him. First summer with his agent, him and his family we managed to keep him. Last summer we offered him a better deal than Chelsea - whatever they offered we matched but he just didn\'t want to stay."It is understood he rejected numerous opportunities to discuss a new contract as his desire to leave Everton was absolute. He then rebuffed further attempts to keep him at the end of last season. Twelve months previously Everton rejected offers from Lukaku\'s former club Chelsea to resign the player.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['Marc Cayeux\'s right knee was shattered and his left foot "left dangling" as he was carried from a burning vehicle on a stretcher made of branches.The Zimbabwean golfer - once in the world\'s top 200 - was not given proper pain relief for 18 hours, a dose of Paracetamol the only antidote for a wounded limb doctors wanted to amputate.Twenty-seven operations have left him an inch shorter, his world ranking has fallen more than 1,500 places, and the "stab wound-like hernia" on his right hip is an everyday reminder of his life-changing car crash in September 2010.After seven weeks in intensive care, three months in hospital and four years learning to walk again, Cayeux has defied the predictions of doctors and physiotherapists to return to professional golf."It would be nice to have a pain-free day, but the reality is it\'s not going to happen," he says. "I have to just get on with things."And that is exactly what the Lancaster-born 39-year-old is doing, making a cut earlier this month for the first time since his return to Africa\'s Sunshine Tour and targeting another at Mauritius in a fortnight.Cayeux talks BBC Sport through his horrific crash and the mental and physical barriers he has overcome in a seven-year journey back to professional sport.It was September 2010 when an oncoming police truck hit a cow in the road, swerved into Cayeux\'s path and crashed head-on into him.He was returning to his parents\' home in Zimbabwe after collecting a new vehicle, having sold both his cars to help cover medical bills after his dad had a stroke."Driving in Zimbabwe at night is very dangerous. The way people drive, the condition of cars, never mind the roads and animals on the roads," says Cayeux, who left England before his first birthday and now lives in George, South Africa."I bounced off both the airbags. The seatbelt did a lot of damage, ripped my abdominal wall just above my hip on the right side - in hospital they had to cut me open and sew it back to my hip bone."Cayeux was unconscious for about half a minute, but came round to hear his friend - who was driving a vehicle in front - calling his name and warning the overturned car was on fire."I remember saying to myself: \'I\'m not going to die like this,\'" he adds. "I moved my right leg and it was instant pain."I tried to move my left leg. It felt OK until I tried to push my body along the roof of the car. I did half a sit-up, lifted my leg and saw my foot dangling. It was quite a painful sight - a lot goes through your mind."Cayeux clambered to safety through a rear passenger door and was carried to his friend\'s vehicle on a stretcher made of branches.It took four hours to reach Zimbabwe\'s capital Harare, in part because police were unwilling to let him leave the scene before a report was compiled.Given makeshift splints for his legs as his friend drove to meet the ambulance halfway, it would be 18 hours before he received proper pain relief."It was quite excruciating pain," Cayeux says. "The only thing they could give me was happy gas - I finished the canister."When we met the ambulance they didn\'t have any morphine. They gave me Paracetamol tablets, which was quite depressing."Cayeux feared doctors would "take the easy option and amputate my left foot" and was relieved to be airlifted to South Africa."I was trying to save my foot, which was a very big concern," he adds. "My brother told the doctor I was a professional golfer and needed my foot."Cayeux spent seven weeks in intensive care, had "countless operations" and contracted MRSA, meaning he was put in an isolation ward and unable to see two-year-old son Ross.Things got tougher for the Cayeux family when Marc\'s pregnant wife Jana miscarried one of the twins she was carrying."Every day you feel every minute, you can\'t wait for visiting hours to see people and try to get your mind off the situation you are in," adds Cayeux."The hardest thing was when my brother came in and told me Jana had miscarried and was in hospital. "I was in the ward, couldn\'t walk. I was so frustrated, I really tried to get out of bed, go see her and be there for her, because she was by my side all the way. I felt very hopeless."After three months, he returned home. But he had little muscle in his legs, spending six weeks in a wheelchair and four years on crutches as he learned to walk again in a hydro swimming pool.A series of operations on his right femur meant that leg was an inch shorter than his left.He says: "I told the doctor: \'I don\'t want to walk around the golf course in circles.\' So we shortened the left femur. Now when I fly economy class I have more leg room."The inch I\'ve had off doesn\'t really affect me. Dealing with the pain is another thing. I don\'t really notice it until I get asked to grab something on a higher shelf and my fingertips are an inch away."Cayeux has now been walking for three years and three months, but has had a golf club in his hand since he could stand on one crutch."I saw a physiotherapist and she told me: \'Your body has beat you too much, you won\'t make it back.\' I said: \'If I had to take your word, I\'ll never know.\' It kind of spurred me on to prove her wrong."But it wasn\'t just the physical recovery Cayeux needed help with. He had post-traumatic depression and saw a psychologist.He says: "It took me a month to say: \'Yeah, I do need help.\' You are recovering and think you\'re on the right road. You think about things positively, but the hardest thing is staying positive."When I learned to walk in a pool, I was going in on my crutches, complaining about pain, until I saw a guy my age in a wheelchair with no legs. It makes you realise, I am lucky with what I have."I stood there going, \'I am going to do this. I have to get back walking and I can get back to golf.\'"Cayeux was playing on the European Tour before his accident in 2010 and says he is indebted to the organisation\'s support, as well as that of compatriot Tony Johnstone."I had no insurance," he said. "Financially, I wouldn\'t be able to try and get back on the Tour, never mind play a friendly round of golf."He played several tournaments at the beginning of the year, but was frustrated with his performance and opted to take time off to work on his reinvented game.It worked - Cayeux finished tied 30th at the Vodacom Origins of Golf Final two weeks ago."It\'s hard for me to miss tournaments when I have been missing them for seven years," adds Cayeux."The mind remembers and knows what to do, but it\'s a different experience having to deal with what I have physically. I\'ve lost yardage and I play with all these young guys that can hit it a mile."He adds: "When I practise, I\'m limited to the amount of golf balls I can hit. I try to stay off the pain medication, I need to give the body a bit of a break."I will probably practise for two or three hours. If I\'m playing 18 holes I will take a cart, just so I don\'t have to take medication to go walking - as much as I need to walk to get the physical strength."Before his accident, Cayeux was paired with Tiger Woods at the 2005 WGC-NEC Invitational and competed at The Open in 2009. He takes inspiration from Ben Hogan, Cayeux turns 40 next year and at some point needs an operation on a hernia he calls "a little uncomfortable" rather than painful, but admits he is "under no pressure to perform"."I want to still get out there and enjoy it, soak up what I can," adds Cayeux. "Next year I will start setting some goals. My wife Jana has been my rock, and it is by God\'s grace that I am here."']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['A radical and bold approach is needed if the European Tour is to fight off challenges that threaten its chances of fulfilling its increasingly promising potential.The most thrilling climax to a Race to Dubai season has just been completed, producing two youthful and charismatic champions with superstar potential.Tommy Fleetwood, aged 26, is an engaging personality who, within the last eighteen months, dramatically turned around a faltering career to become Three years younger, Spain\'s Jon Rahm, emphasised his class with victory in the season-ending DP World Tour Championship. Both are players capable of generating serious interest in the game.But sadly from the European Tour\'s point of view, both will also set sights on the PGA Tour in the United States. Rahm is already based in the US and Fleetwood, fresh from edging out Justin Rose to the Race title, says he wants to play more across the Atlantic Ocean.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Such are the facts of life on the men\'s professional circuit.  The US schedule remains an irresistible lure despite prize fund inflation in Europe. In 2016 the tour\'s 100th ranked player banked 275,000 Euros, this year the reward was 389,000.Sheffield\'s Matt Fitzpatrick, 23,  is now preparing to move to Florida and join a long established exodus. Nevertheless, the European Tour does possess a boldness and energy to suggest it can further develop despite the relentless dominance of its American rivals.Two years into his stewardship,  has instilled a fresher and more business orientated outlook. He knows not enough sports fans are consuming professional golf and is striving to arrest the decline.Under the 53-year-old Canadian chief executive\'s leadership, the Tour has found ways, via a string of inspired social media films, to bring golfers\' personalities to the general public.It\'s ironic to think the process began a year ago with a "mannequin challenge" because it is one area where the Tour and its producers have not stood still.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Recent offerings include pro\'s trying to drive onto a two-yard wide fairway,  and Eduardo Molinari spending all day trying to hit a hole in one.Going forward, Pelley is promising more of the same. "We are a content entertainment company where our players are performers and golf is the platform," he said."We believe that creating innovative, entertaining content to showcase our players in a completely different light is undeniably the way forward."  It will be fascinating to see how his philosophy impacts forthcoming television negotiations because Pelley wants the widest possible audience for his players.  He is not afraid of being innovative in searching for reach. Last week\'s Hero Challenge - a knockabout curtain raiser to the main event in Dubai - was live streamed on Twitter.Pelley has employed Stu Nicol from the PGA Tour as a new head of broadcasting and Michael Cole has been hired as head of technology.  "If you think about the way the world is going, people want to watch what they want when they want, how they want," Pelley said."We are making technology a very important part of the growth of the European Tour."Growth is the buzzword. And if golf wants to move with the times it might also think about how relevant single-sex organisations are in a modern sporting environment.Perhaps this is why the European Tour recently offered its assistance to the struggling Ladies European Tour."We tried to get involved," Pelley told BBC Sport. "We actually presented to the LET board along with Mike Whan from the LPGA a couple of months ago."We had a three-way partnership with ourselves, the LPGA and the R&A."It\'s very important for the LET to flourish. They have decided at this particular time to try to rebuild the LET on their own.  "But we have said to them we are here whenever you need us."Given the rapid growth of women\'s sport and golf\'s constant struggle to shed its debilitating elitist and sexist image, a merging of the two European Tours makes a lot of sense.Not to create a schedule of mixed tournaments but to pool resources, marketing opportunities and present the kind of enlightened image that serves so well the likes of cricket and tennis. If they are genuinely seeking to maintain relevance and grow for golf it should happen. And if it does, we will know that there is indeed a genuinely progressive golfing agenda. Opportunities abound for the European Tour and being bold and radical is their only option.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

It was all about the standard of his game after a 301-day absence from competition.And while his performance was not perfect, to finish the Hero Challenge eight under par in a share of ninth place was highly encouraging.Yes, this was a fun, season-ending shootout with a field limited to only 18 competitors, but Woods still beat PGA Tour player of the year Justin Thomas, world number one Dustin Johnson and the  Brooks Koepka.Woods fired rounds of 69, 68, 75 and 68 and had two eagles, 17 birdies and only one double bogey. Albany is a resort course and there are far tougher golfing tests but realistically Woods could not have asked for more from his return."Some of the shots he hit, I just thought that\'s vintage Tiger," European Ryder Cup star Chris Wood told BBC Sport."You can see the speed in the swing and that\'s the biggest thing.  In the final round he hit a two iron over the back of the green, pitching it 250 yards. He\'s doing something right there isn\'t he?"Woods\' putting stroke also looked very assured and the only apparent weaknesses occurred with some touch shots around the greens that went awry."Those are the sort of things, when you come back after a break, your golfing brain takes a couple of rounds to get back into it," Wood pointed out."I thought there were so many positives for him last week and I think he\'d be over the moon with that performance."And the  is thrilled that golf\'s biggest personality is back in the game. Wood says it was his near namesake who inspired him to take up the sport."I grew up with him, he won his first Masters when I was 10 years old," Wood said."I think for anybody of my generation, there\'s been a void in the last two, three, four years when Tiger\'s not been there. It\'s just not been the same.  "You watch last week and not just me but so many people on Twitter were making so many comments and non golfers as well.  "It does so much for the game and it makes you feel that golf is really something special when Tiger\'s playing. All of a sudden it\'s in other news outlets and people are talking about it and it really, really makes you want to watch."Woods commands such attention he often overshadows other players in the field, but Wood has no time for those who see this as a problem."I think that\'s madness," said the 30-year-old Bristolian. "I find it amazing that people can comment like that. How can you not be a fan of Tiger Woods in 2000 or 2005? Whenever he was playing his best golf. "Things have happened in his life that not everyone is going to agree with, but as a golfer you cannot hold anything against him, he\'s just been incredible for the game.  "Most players will say it, we are in tournaments for prize funds based on interest in the game and most of it was down to Tiger Woods."Now Woods is preparing to work out which tournaments to enter next year based around the major championships. He is looking to pace himself and seems to be processing a less ambitious schedule than the one he set out this time last year.His aim then was to play three weeks in a row at the start of this year, beginning at Torrey Pines. There he missed the cut before  in Dubai the following week with his season in ruins.A more cautious approach this time makes sense.  He will turn 42 before we next see him back in action and he was still using precautionary anti-inflammatory tablets in the Bahamas last week.Woods has to manage a back that has one fewer joint due to last April\'s disc fusion surgery. That, inevitably, means stress being referred to other areas and how they cope is an unknown quantity.Nevertheless, he looked fit, healthy, strong and happy. That\'s a potent combination for a golfer of his immense feats.It is more than reasonable to expect Woods will inject huge interest and buzz into the 2018 golfing calendar. "He brings so much more to an event," Wood told me."Top, top sportsmen in the world, or sportswomen, they have this aura - like Beckham did or Ronaldo or Roger Federer. Tiger\'s got that and certainly not in my generation has there been a golfer with that same sort of superstar aura."He\'s just got to walk on to the range and you\'ve got a sense that he is there."Wood played in the same group as Woods back in 2013 at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational when the former world number one collected the  to date. "When I was playing as a junior I\'d dream of playing with Tiger Woods and there I was in the last group in a World Golf Championship on a Saturday and it was an awesome experience," Wood said.  Now there is the enticing prospect of Woods competing with the generation of players he inspired and who currently dominate the game. "Everyone wants to see Tiger head to head with Spieth or Thomas or Rory (McIlroy) and players like that," Wood added."They\'ve got everything to gain in that situation and that just makes it even better for golf."Woods still has a long way to go on the comeback trail. Let\'s see how he does against full fields of elite players on courses set up to the penal standards of the PGA Tour.Much more evidence is required before anyone could reliably predict another era of Tiger dominance. But the fact that he is palpably up for the fight is well worth celebrating.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

That\'s the nature of sports fans and particularly golf aficionados, who have influenced results throughout the television era by spotting player mistakes.Somehow they found means to contact the authorities, prompting retrospective penalties such as the  to Lexi Thompson\'s scorecard at this year\'s ANA Inspiration in California.On that occasion an emailer alerted referees to the fact that the American star had erroneously replaced her ball during the third round.It came to a light a day later, but in time for her to be docked two strokes for playing a short putt from the wrong position.Thompson was given a further two-shot penalty for signing for the wrong third-round score, and these sanctions effectively cost her a major title.Under the rule changes just announced, this can no longer happen. Viewer interventions will be ignored and the penalty for unwittingly signing for the wrong scorecard in such circumstances has been scrapped.It is a welcome move because golf was out of step with pretty much every other sport where spectators at home are powerless to influence events, even when they spot a blatant rules breach.The Thompson incident highlighted a situation where a tournament was being played under a false scoreboard until her mistake had been highlighted - and that was a day late."In my case, I am thankful that no-one else will have to deal with an outcome such as mine in the future," Thompson said in response to the new changes.But it should be remembered that it would be unjust for such errors to go unpunished. This is why the main tours of the men\'s and women\'s games have agreed to new protocols.One or more television rules officials will monitor coverage, looking to spot the kind of mistakes that used to be picked up by alert viewers.In many quarters, these armchair officials were described as nothing more than interfering busy bodies, but the fact is their actions helped to ensure correct scoring.Nevertheless it was a deeply unsatisfactory way to conduct professional sport. The rules should be administered by referees and by the golfers themselves.The onus is also on them to ensure they and their playing partners proceed correctly. This is one of the unique characteristics of the game of golf that should be preserved. But with millions of pounds and the integrity of the sport on the line pretty much every week, it is vital referees play an enhanced role.It would have been quite wrong for Thompson to have escaped unpunished for giving herself an easier putt when she replaced her ball marginally closer to the hole.She gained huge sympathy at the time but that came from how the penalty was imposed and for the two extra strokes she was given because she unwittingly signed for the wrong third-round score.Now the ball is firmly in the court of the officials on the course and in TV trucks - where they can observe a multitude of feeds - at the game\'s biggest events."As technology has continued to evolve, it has allowed us to evolve how we operate as well," observed Thomas Pagel, the USGA\'s senior director of rules.Finally, it seems the authorities are realising that the game cannot tolerate unnecessary rules controversies.The USGA were at the heart of the fiasco surrounding a  during the final round of his 2016 US Open triumph. During the controversy - farcically only resolved at the end of play - competitors and viewers were uncertain of the proper score.While these latest rule changes do not alter how that incident would have played out, they do reduce the scope for scoring alterations late in the day and that should be applauded.The fans will still watch with their eagle eyes and, no doubt, readily take to social media to highlight acts of wrongdoing as and when they see fit.There is still scope for controversy and injustice to surface, but - from 1 January next year - only if the newly appointed television officials take their eye off the ball.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ["Justin Rose's latest victory capped another fine year for UK golf with home success across the globe and at varying levels of the game.Rose was the standard bearer despite spending many months wondering whether 2017 would prove one of those nearly years. There was a discernible hangover after losing his Masters play-off against Sergio Garcia.However, the 37-year-old Englishman concluded his season in astonishing style. Never out of the top ten in his last ten tournaments, he romped to a third victory in that spell by finishing 29 under par  winning by eight strokes.Rose plays with seemingly unshakeable confidence when he feels he is better than any of his rivals on a leaderboard. He has earned this sense of arrogance through sustained excellence.It is the fifth time since 2012 he has finished a year inside the top seven in the world. Twelve months ago he had slipped to 15th in the rankings but heads into the new year knocking loudly on the door of the top five.Even so, the current world number six will still feel that a couple of titles escaped his grasp. The Masters was the prime example but also November's DP World Tour Championship.In that Dubai event it was interesting to witness how uncertainty suddenly crept into his play just when eventual winner Jon Rahm, the only player ranked higher than him in the field, charged into contention.Nevertheless, Rose - the 2013 US Open winner - is long established as golfer of formidable pedigree. He will be targeting his return to Augusta next April with the primary objective of becoming a multiple major champion.The Olympic gold medallist's near miss at the Masters was the closest the UK came to a major victory in 2017. But there was still much to cheer, even though our golfers probably failed to garner due recognition from the wider sporting public.There are five UK players in the world's top 18 and English players celebrated no fewer than 10 victories on the European Tour. Race to Dubai winner Tommy Fleetwood and Tyrrell Hatton joined Rose in landing multiple triumphs.Graeme Storm set the tone by holding off Rory McIlroy in South Africa last January while Matt Wallace (Portuguese Open) and Matthew Fitzpatrick (European Masters) celebrated notable victories.So too did Bath's Jordan Smith at the European Open in July. The 25-year-old Challenge Tour graduate possesses a glorious swing and an enviable winning habit with five professional victories already to his name.The production line of English talent shows no sign of drying up. Georgia Hall, the 21-year-old from Dorset, won the Ladies European Tour order of merit and finished an encouraging third in the Ricoh Women's British Open.She also made a fine  winning both her foursomes matches despite Europe falling to a heavy defeat in Iowa last August.Among the unpaid ranks, Harry Ellis became only the third player to win both the Amateur Championship and the English Amateur while Alfie Plant won the European title.Those in charge at England Golf should take great pride in the way their elite talent is continuing to develop.They should also be congratulated on their desire to modernise the grassroots game to encourage more youngsters to take up the sport.A significant step was taken recently to streamline England Golf's board, reducing it from 15 to 12 members. This is the sort of administrative change that might not seem important at first glance.However, they have created a more balanced leadership with greater diversity which filters through to county representatives. This ensures England Golf meets the government's Gold Standard, which allows public money to flow into the game. Find out how to get into golf with our .Just as importantly it keeps golf in line with other progressive sports and this is vital to the cause of shedding the stuffy, elitist image which so often holds it back.There is still a long way for the game to go in this regard but it is increasingly becoming a top priority for those who run the sport.The constant flow of young, exciting and charismatic talent can only help the cause.  Scotland's Connor Syme turned professional after playing the Walker Cup and immediately finished 12th in the Portugal Masters. The 22-year-old's management group - Modest! Golf - is backed by One Direction's Niall Horan and having subsequently come through European Tour Q School, there is compelling evidence that Syme's career is heading in the right direction.And the fact that golf holds appeal for pop stars such as Horan, suggests potential for it to become increasingly relevant to a younger generation of fans.  Especially, given that 2017 has shown that there is no shortage of home success to celebrate."]	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['Thomas Bjorn is about to try out captaincy skills on likely members of his Ryder Cup team and Tiger Woods has chosen to resume his PGA Tour career at a course where he has enjoyed eight victories.At face value both have much to gain from these encouraging scenarios.  This week Bjorn leads Europe against Asia in the appropriately named EurAsia Cup and on 25 January  at Torrey Pines near San Diego. They are separate narratives but share in common the fact that they both carry elements of risk. Woods has won seven tour titles and a  at the Californian venue for the Farmers Insurance Open. In his current circumstances, though, he has given himself the toughest of tests for his first genuinely competitive tournament for a year.Yes, there were encouraging signs  in the Bahamas last month, but competing at Torrey Pines against a full PGA Tour field is a different proposition.The North and South courses are severe tests, especially the latter which measures more than 7,600 yards. Since winning there in 2013, Woods\' record is awful - finishing 80th, withdrawing through injury and last year missing the cut.Easier options were available, including either the upcoming Abu Dhabi Championship or Dubai Desert Classic where the weather would be warmer and the courses less physically demanding.No doubt, though, Woods feels a sense of duty that his latest return should be made on his home tour. In which case he might have been better heading to the January events in Hawaii or La Quinta - where the tournament title, the Career Builder Challenge, offers a coincidentally appropriate feel.Instead he will take on Torrey Pines and then plans to play the Genesis Open at Riviera in Los Angeles, which is another formidable examination. It is one of the few regular tour stops where he has yet to register a win, despite 11 attempts.As an important event for his foundation, this tournament was always likely to figure on the 42 year old\'s schedule. But in the wider context of the resumption of his career it represents another tough hurdle.The risk is that it may take longer for Woods to gain much needed momentum and confidence than if he had chosen easier venues.With risk, though, comes reward and were he to make cuts and end either week at the right end of the leaderboard he would generate vast quantities of self-belief and stoke expectation.Bjorn, meanwhile, is looking to reap the rewards of using a team environment to familiarise himself with several players likely to make his Ryder Cup team in September.The Dane captains a formidable-looking European line-up against Asia this week at the Glenmarie Golf and Country Club in Kuala Lumpur. Ten of the dozen players are ranked inside the world\'s top 42, including number nine Henrik Stenson and Paul Casey, 14 in the world. The average ranking of their Asian opponents is 127."We have a strong team but the great thing for me is that I will get to spend some time with all of them and with the younger players in particular, in a team environment," Bjorn told readers of "When they come into that team-room environment it is a little bit different and the hierarchy evolves with some senior players showing the way while the younger players will lean on them a little bit."But the golfers Bjorn will be captaining are just returning from their Christmas breaks. There may be understandable rust and that might make them vulnerable."It\'s all well and good for Thomas to be leading a strong team, but there is a risk," a leading figure at the European Tour told me. "What if we were lose? You have to think about that."It means there\'s quite a bit on the line in the EurAsia Cup."Two years ago Darren Clarke kicked off Ryder Cup year with an emphatic  with a European team that included five players who went on to face the Americans at With the likes of Stenson, Casey, Tommy Fleetwood, Tyrell Hatton, Alex Noren, Ross Fisher and Matt Fitzpatrick in action we can expect a sizeable number of this team to also be on duty for the mission to win back the Ryder Cup later in the year."As well as spending quality time with the players, the EurAsia Cup will also give them a little bit of a different perspective in how they see me," Bjorn observed."Day in, day out, they see me as a player, inside the ropes, playing the game with them. "Now I am in a different role and that week will give me the chance to build relationships that might well stand me in good stead in France next September."The 24 players involved will split $4.8m in prize money but this is more than a lucrative early season friendly knockabout.  European team members have their chance to make a big impression on the Ryder Cup skipper, while Bjorn himself has the opportunity to learn plenty about his role.There is much to be gained, but against a team that boasts only two top 50 players - Yuta Ikeda (36) and Kiradech Aphibarnrat (49), Europe\'s skipper can ill-afford his confidence being knocked by a shock defeat.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['Lewis Hamilton or Ayrton Senna - who is the most talented driver?It\'s a difficult question to answer and one BBC Sport readers are split on. When we  after Hamilton won his fourth world title last month the two drivers topped the vote with 29%.Determining who is the most talented driver is, of course, a matter of opinion and attempting to compare drivers from different eras is difficult because of the significant changes in technology, reliability and human athleticism over the years. So instead of trying to suggest who is better we will simply look at some of the statistics from both drivers\' careers.During his decade in Formula 1, Senna won 41 of his 162 races, making for a win percentage of 25.31%.Hamilton, meanwhile, has won 62 of the 206 grands prix he has competed in and has a win percentage of 30.09%.In terms of points gained, Senna claimed 41% of the possible 1491 that were available to him between 1984 and 1994.Since making his debut in 2007, Hamilton has taken an impressive 58% of the 4420 points available.  In his 11 seasons in F1, the Briton has taken more than half of the maximum points available in a year on eight occasions.It was in qualifying where Senna towered above his contemporaries. His ability to take his car to the absolute limit and produce a blistering single lap blew his rivals out of the water."Those great drivers are able to pull out an extraordinary lap," Williams technical chief Paddy Lowe, one of the few to work with both Senna and Hamilton, said earlier this year."They can\'t do it every Saturday but every now and again they just go out there and something really extraordinary is required and they produce a lap where you go, \'Wow, where on earth did that come from?\' "And Lewis is certainly one to do that, and so was Ayrton."Hamilton equalled and then broke Senna\'s record of 65 pole positions earlier this season before moving ahead of Michael Schumacher on the all-time list at the Italian Grand Prix in September. He now has 72 career pole positions - more than any other driver in history.It\'s hard to condense two great drivers\' most memorable moments into a couple of paragraphs given there are so many, but there are perhaps one or two that stand above the rest.For Senna, his stunning victory at the 1993 European Grand Prix at Donnington would top many people\'s lists of the Brazilian\'s greatest races. Dropping to fifth at the start, Senna swiftly overtook everyone to take the lead by the end of the lap, somehow finding grip on a sodden circuit, before taking command of the race, winning it by one minute and 23 seconds.Then, of course, there were his many Monaco moments including his simply astounding lap for pole in 1988 when he out qualified team-mate Alain Prost by a whopping 1.427 seconds.As for Hamilton, how about his Formula 1 debut at the 2007 Australian Grand Prix? The then 22-year-old passing his team-mate and double world champion Fernando Alonso on his way to a podium finish. Or what about the 2008 British Grand Prix? When Hamilton produced one of his many masterful displays in the wet, lapping the entire field on the way to winning the race by 68 seconds.As for his best qualifying displays, there are too many to mention. This year alone he has produced several scintillating pole position laps - from Canada where he fittingly equalled Senna\'s pole positions record with a lap his idol would have been proud of, to his blistering display for the Italian Grand Prix, finishing a full second quicker than his rivals at the home of Ferrari.Lewis\'s talent is there to see, regardless of the car. He is an extremely gifted racer. F1 contemporaries and legends alike, e.g Lauda, Mansell, Stewart, Alonso, Hakkinen, Prost, Moss, Hill et al. have lauded Hamilton as one of the best ever. Even Vettel himself said Lewis was "the better man this year." Yet a bunch of bitter non-racers are desperate to talk his achievements down. Makes no sense.Having watched F1 since 1960 and attending the 63\' and 65\' British GP I can say that Jim Clark is head and shoulders above any other driver in my lifetime. Mansell the bravest and Prost the most fortunate as he inherited the 86\' title and was the most political driver of his era. Senna & Schumacher selfish and dangerous on their day. Stewart & Hill good but dull to watch.It\'s impossible to compare drivers of different eras due to technology etc. Senna was an outstanding qualifier (probably the best ever), but Prost scored more points in both their seasons together and had a better average finishing position. Senna was also far more guilty of causing deliberate collisions than either Vettel or Schumacher, something many commentators conveniently overlook. Senna definitely top 5 or 6 of all time, but Jim Clark is clear #1 for me.']	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ['Lewis Hamilton is now one of the best drivers of all time.The 32-year-old has won his fourth world title, eclipsing Sir Jackie Stewart\'s record to become Britain\'s most successful Formula 1 driver ever.Hamilton has his idol Ayrton Senna\'s speed - but Michael Schumacher continues to dominate the statistics. The German has more titles (seven) and more wins (91) than Hamilton, but how long before the Briton catches up? He\'s on his way...If Hamilton wants to leave the sport with the most world titles of all time, he\'s going to have to stick around for at least another four seasons.He is currently three behind Schumacher\'s all-time record but time is very much on his side. Schumacher was the same age - 32- as Hamilton when he won his fourth title and went on to win it again in the next three seasons.Hamilton\'s former team-mate, Jenson Button, believes his compatriot will at the very least equal Schumacher\'s record."When you look at the facts and the stats, he\'s out-qualified Michael but in terms of world championships he\'s got a little way to go," Button told BBC Sport."Michael is still the greatest when you look at the outright results but if Lewis stays in the sport and if Mercedes stay as competitive, you could see him getting close to winning seven world championships - but only time will tell."Hamilton is a driver who you get the sense won\'t be fully satisfied until his name is at the top of all notable record charts in Formula 1. Schumacher\'s seven world titles will be his main ambition but he will also be keen to take the German\'s record of most wins. Schumacher is currently way out in front on 91 but Hamilton is creeping closer...So how realistic is it that Hamilton could overtake Schumacher\'s wins record?As the below graphic shows, Hamilton really started to rack up the wins after his first season at Mercedes. Since the start of 2014, when Mercedes produced a competitive car, he has won 40 races - an average of 10 per season. If he maintains that form then he could feasibly surpass Schumacher by the end of 2020, when he is 35. Given that Schumacher won the last of his seven world titles at that age, then, assuming Hamilton continues to have a car capable of battling for wins, he has every chance of achieving that feat long before he decides to hang up his racing gloves.For Stewart, the best is still to come from Hamilton."The halcyon years are your mid-30s," he said."You have maturity, you still have strength, you are still learning but you have corrected a lot of knowledge. "You are still vibrant and still hungry."If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please Hamilton\'s win on Sunday was his 62nd in 205 races. It\'s a hugely impressive record but, in terms of win ratio and how it compares with other British drivers, legendary Scottish driver Jim Clark remains out in front.Clark, world champion in 1963 and 1965, won 25 races during his career. It was a record at the time and although it has since been surpassed by several other drivers after the Scot\'s tragic death, none in so few races. Clark\'s came in just 72 starts, a win ratio bettered only by Alberto Ascari and Juan Manuel Fangio.Stewart, the man who Hamilton replaced as Britain\'s most successful driver in terms of world titles, believes his compatriot is a worthy successor."I have held the record for 44 years and records are meant to be broken," said Stewart."He has earned it. He has made big decisions. He left McLaren and that was a surprise to a lot of people including me. He made that right decision and went to Mercedes, it was a big decision and the right decision. He has learnt so much. "Niki Lauda has been able to guide Lewis very well. He has huge experience, he is three-time world champion and been through so much, a lot more than me and in fact died twice and was resuscitated. Niki has been able to guide Lewis a great deal and soften some of the emotions from time to time. "Lewis has been in a great team with a great package but nevertheless you have to drive the car and get it to the finish line."It seems only right that Hamilton becomes the most decorated British driver of all time in a season he wrote history.By taking the 69th pole position of his career for the Italian Grand Prix in September he broke Schumacher\'s long-standing pole positions record. And in Austin he surpassed the German\'s record of front row starts to 117.Hamilton has since moved on to 72 career pole positions, meaning by the time he does retire the bar will be set extremely high for any future Formula 1 drivers hoping to become the king of qualifying.But given the way Hamilton is going, it\'s not the only record Hamilton will leave others reaching for when his driving career does finally come to an end.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ["BBC Sport readers overwhelming predicted Lewis Hamilton would be the best driver in 2017.Prior to the start of the season we asked you to predict which three drivers would be up there battling for the title and 72% of you backed the Briton to come out on top.Anticipating Sebastian Vettel would be Hamilton's main rival in qualifying and on race day, 15% of users of BBC Sport's selector thought the German could win his fifth world championship.And a Kimi Raikkonen renaissance was anticipated by a sizeable number as 4.4% of you felt the Finn would be the best in class.In the end you were not far off as Hamilton won the title ahead of Vettel, but it seems Valtteri Bottas' first season at Mercedes caught you by surprise.The Finn proved an able team-mate for Hamilton, taking three wins on his way to finishing third in the drivers' championship.However, he was not tipped by BBC Sport readers to be the third best driver this season. Or the fourth. Or even the fifth. Instead he was sixth, with just 1.43%. Daniel Ricciardo (2.42%) and Max Verstappen (2.77%) were backed to perform better than Bottas.BBC Sport's chief F1 writer Andrew Benson was also expecting the Red Bull drivers to put up a stronger fight than they did.This is the question no-one wants to be the answer to but, sadly, it has to be someone.Marcus Ericsson was selected more than any other driver to be propping up the standings on the most occasions. He was first pick in 30% of BBC Sport readers' worst drivers of the season.It was a fair prediction as the Swede, in a struggling Sauber, failed to score any points this year with his best results being 11th-place finishes in Spain and Azerbaijan.Ericsson's Sauber team-mate Pascal Wehrlein was the second most picked (18%), while Stoffel Vandoorne was third (15%).In the end, Vandoorne arguably surpassed expectations, particularly in the second half of the season. Three top-10 finishes meant he ended the year on 13 points, just four fewer than his McLaren team-mate and two-time world champion Fernando Alonso.Nope. Mercedes topped this one. They have been the dominant team since 2014 and BBC Sport readers backed them to keep it up through 2017 with 69%.Still, plenty of people expected Ferrari to put up a strong challenge with 25% of BBC Sport selector users suggesting they could be fastest. Red Bull (3%) were the best of the rest.After the season they had in 2016, it might have been tempting for some BBC Sport readers to suggest McLaren were in for a tough time but they were not the most selected in this instance (22%).Instead, that ignominy went to Sauber (46%), with Haas the third most selected team to be the slowest this year on 19%."]	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ['The race that finally clinched it was a bit messy, through no fault of his own, but the season in which Lewis Hamilton  has underlined his status as one of Formula 1\'s all-time greats.Hamilton\'s best is of a standard few have ever matched, and this year he produced his best perhaps more often than ever before. Now the holder of the all-time record for pole positions, he put together at least five qualifying laps to rank with the best he has ever done - Montreal, Baku, Silverstone, Monza and Malaysia were each breathtaking in the way they redefined the perception of what was possible. Of his nine wins so far, at least three were of the very highest calibre, and in very different ways - he fought back to catch and pass Vettel in Spain, held off a faster Ferrari in Belgium, and came through against the odds with pace his team did not know they had in wet-dry Singapore. And three others, in Britain, Italy and the USA, were utterly dominant.For much of the year, Hamilton was fighting a rival, Ferrari\'s Sebastian Vettel, whose car was probably better than his Mercedes as an overall package and certainly less temperamental. And yet he has won more than twice as many races as the German and nearly three times as many pole positions.Undoubtedly, Hamilton was helped by Ferrari\'s implosion over three races in Asia in September and October, when a driving error by Vettel and two engine problems effectively ended their challenge.But over the season Hamilton was calmer, more impressive, more consistent, more reliable and raced better."He deserves it," a downcast Vettel said on Sunday evening in Mexico. "He had a very, very strong season. Two races to go he clinches the championship. In a straight fight, he was the better man. So, congratulations."Hamilton\'s season has been a triumph in ways beyond simply the pure racing. He has also set new standards for the sport statistically, and for himself as a professional.Hamilton already holds the all-time record for pole positions, broken at this year\'s Italian Grand Prix. At 72 and counting, who knows where he might leave that by the end of his career?In terms of titles, he is now in exalted company with only four other drivers in history - fellow quadruple champions Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel, five-time winner Juan Manuel Fangio and record holder Michael Schumacher, who has seven. At just 32 and in the best team, that all-time mark looks reachable now.Schumacher\'s win record of 91 grands prix appeared insurmountable for a time, but even that is now looking vulnerable to a man who already has 62, and who has won 40 in the last four years.Hamilton\'s fourth title makes him unquestionably the greatest British racing driver ever in statistical terms, even if strictly speaking he was already that, given he was equal with Sir Jackie Stewart on three titles and had at least twice as many wins as anyone else.Hamilton says he carries the flag with pride, and that he is honoured to be in this position. But this achievement has a meaning that goes beyond patriotism. Stewart, Jim Clark, Stirling Moss; some of the men he has now surpassed in career numbers, and to whom he is being compared, are among those regarded to be the very greatest the sport has ever produced. Which says a lot about Hamilton.Statistics are not the only thing define greatness in an F1 driver; they are just part of the equation, something to be taken into account but considered alongside a whole raft of other factors. That is why some still regard the stylish and low-key Clark, a two-time champion in the 1960s with 25 wins from 72 grands prix, as the greatest of all time. For others it is Fangio - 24 wins from 51 races; five titles in seven years, all won over the age of 40. Or Ayrton Senna - three championships, 41 wins in 161 races and a legend as a global icon even before his death at 34. Or Schumacher. Or even Moss, who never won a title but bestrode the era between Fangio and Clark.The multiplicity of names, and the variety of careers, underlines the difficulty of the question of who is the greatest racing driver ever, and the elusiveness of an answer. But what is unarguable is that Hamilton should be regarded among that exalted company, that his quality shines above and beyond the numbers, and that he possesses all the attributes that define greatness.Over one lap, in terms of sheer unadulterated speed, he is unsurpassed - perhaps ever. His race-craft is superb. His skills in the wet are sublime. His adaptability means he can perform in any car in any conditions. As a racing driver out on track, there are no apparent weaknesses.Of course Hamilton has flaws, like any other human being. In the past, his failing has been to be "a bit up and down", as it was put recently by his former team-mate Nico Rosberg.In the past, the suspicion is that inconsistency was caused by psychological factors, which Rosberg ruthlessly exploited to hammer home the advantage that better reliability gave him in their final battle last year.This year, the variability in his form has had a different root - the behaviour of his car. The Mercedes has had a very specific weakness this year. Its technical causes are too complex to go into here, but fundamentally it was not competitive on circuits that required maximum downforce and had a low-grip track surface.For the first half of the season, Hamilton struggled on these types of circuits, and was out-qualified and out-scored by new team-mate Valtteri Bottas in Russia, Monaco, Austria and Hungary.This was down to a refusal to accept the limits of the car, an attempt to force it to do more than it was capable of. The result was he over-drove and made mistakes.That\'s why for much of the year, Hamilton was playing catch-up, Vettel and Ferrari a more consistent combination and one that appeared it would be difficult to beat.At the summer break, after 11 races, the two were tied on four wins each, Vettel leading by 13 points. Since then, Hamilton has won five races; Vettel none. The secret was in the work Hamilton did behind the scenes, with the closeness of his relationship with his team, with his maturity, his focus and dedication at understanding how to get the best out of a difficult car. And his calm head out on track.He worked hard with his engineers at finding a way to minimise this weakness as much as possible and his second half of the season has been incredibly impressive. He won the races he was expected to and where Mercedes were strong - Belgium, Italy, Japan and the USA. But more importantly he excelled where they were not. His qualifying performance at Malaysia, that put him on pole at a race where the Mercedes was the third fastest car, was arguably the lap of the season - along with the one at Monza in the wet, when he was more than a second clear of anyone else.He was helped by the three-car pile-up that took out both Ferraris and Max Verstappen\'s Red Bull in Singapore. But no-one expected that once that gifted him the lead, he would out-pace Red Bull\'s Daniel Ricciardo behind him. Even the Mercedes engineers were flummoxed by where that came from.After the race, Hamilton spoke eloquently and expansively, sometimes almost free-associating, about his achievement, what it meant to him, and the future."It is crazy to think I have matched some of these records," he said. "They have crept up on me. But there are potentially many more years to go." \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        And then he addressed the lifestyle that some people seem to find makes a fundamentally well-meaning, concerned, honest, open and generous person hard to like."I do look at my life," he said. "I travel so much. It is a lot of sacrifice. To stand out in the world today, it is a lot harder because it has all been done before - to do something different as an F1 driver, not only be as great as you can be as a driver but also to do other things, to prepare your after-life to be just as great. "F1 is the pinnacle of the sport but it doesn\'t mean you can\'t still do great things. Doing something different that helps you stand out that highlights your individuality is really important and that is something I am working on."I will continue to race while I love it, but I do think that it would be really nice at some stage to live in one place for a period of time. But then I think there is a lot of life to live beyond 40, and I can\'t come back to F1. "There will be point when I have had enough. I have been very blessed. And I want to go out on top. That is my goal. There is more to come. Hard times ahead, more challenge, and I love that." The race that decided the title began with a collision between the two men who have disputed it. And shortly afterwards Hamilton asked his team if he felt Vettel had done it deliberately. Afterwards, though, Hamilton was full of praise for Vettel, saying he was "as tough as they come" as a rival, that he had done "an exceptional job this year".That crash, and subsequent puncture, meant a drive through the field for both men. And it was fitting in its way that Hamilton\'s last tussle, over ninth place, was with McLaren\'s Fernando Alonso, with whom he fought a cataclysmic battle in his first season in F1 10 years ago.Earlier in the weekend, Hamilton was discussing potential future team-mates, and the challenge they might present, and he said: "I already feel like I\'ve raced against the best here, which in my personal opinion is Fernando."That same day, Alonso was asked whether he regarded Hamilton as one of the five greatest drivers in history."Yes," the Spaniard replied. "In F1, every single season he has been very competitive, apart from one or two with Jenson (Button) when he had some issues. He was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. "Not all the champions can say that."']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['Williams appear to be in a bit of a pickle over their driver choice for the 2018 season.The clear plan was for Robert Kubica to make a fairytale comeback seven years after the rally accident that left him with life-changing injuries and partner Canadian Lance Stroll, who is under contract.If it is workable, that strategy has lots of positives. Kubica was one of his generation\'s leading talents and the theory was that even if his injuries meant he was not quite what he was, he would be dependable and fast, and his excellent technical feedback would provide Williams with a solid baseline for car development. On top of that, a man returning seven years after an accident that nearly killed him and with only partial movement in his right arm is a great story to tell that would mean lots of positive exposure.But it seems there has been a hitch. Williams planned to make their decision after running Kubica in the end-of-season tyre test in Abu Dhabi this week.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        But his performance was inconclusive and now Williams are saying they want to take their time, analyse all the data and carefully look at all their options before making a decision.So how did Kubica do? Did he do enough to convince Williams he can make a return? And if not, what do they do?It is very hard for outsiders to be definitive about pace from testing times. But on the face of it, it seems Kubica did not make a compelling case for Williams to sign him during his  at Yas Marina.The 32-year-old\'s fastest lap was a time of one minute 39.485 seconds. That\'s 0.9secs slower than lead Williams driver Felipe Massa managed in qualifying at the grand prix four days before, despite Kubica being on softer tyres.But although Massa\'s performance is a benchmark for Williams, the times cannot necessarily be compared - they were on different days, in different conditions, on different tyres and almost certainly with different engine modes. Kubica was 0.1secs faster than Stroll had been the previous day on the same tyres - but the Canadian was a second off Massa\'s pace throughout the Abu Dhabi race weekend.Sergey Sirotkin, the Renault development driver who Williams were also evaluating at the test, was just under 0.5secs slower than Kubica on the same day. But he was running in hotter - and therefore slower - conditions and using the \'soft\' tyre while Kubica was on the new hyper-soft, and there is about a two-second off-set in the tyres.So just looking at the basics of what is known - tyre performance and lap time - Kubica was in effect 1.6secs slower than Sirotkin. Which does not look good.Kubica\'s fastest lap was set on a three-lap, qualifying-style run just before 1800 local time. It was, in other words, effectively a qualifying simulation aimed at extracting maximum pace.But Williams will not reveal the fuel load, so that\'s a variable, and it\'s not known how good a lap it was from the driver - ie, did he make a mistake, did he get the best out of Pirelli\'s notoriously difficult tyres etc?In fact, Kubica appears to have done a lap that was better than that on the first day of the test, Tuesday. Then, he set a 1:41.296 on soft tyres on a five-lap run. Correct that for the tyre off-set (ie, calculate what it would have been had he used the hyper-softs) and the minimum amount of fuel he must have had to complete the run, and it compares to a 1:39.1. The lap was also done at midday, when the track would be close to its slowest.That\'s nearly 0.5secs quicker than Stroll did on the same day. But still 1.3secs off Sirotkin\'s corrected best on Wednesday, which was also done in the middle of the day.So Kubica did not look quick enough to make the decision to sign him a no-brainer. Complicating matters, the test programmes involved many variables in the car - such as engine mode, cooling specification and so on. And also in track conditions - for example, the track was slower on the morning of the first day, when Kubica set his de facto quickest time, than the morning of the second, when Sirotkin set his.All of which is an illustration of how difficult it is going to be for Williams to make a definitive judgment on Kubica\'s pace and potential.Speaking on the first day of the test, Kubica sounded like he felt he was ready to make a comeback.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        "There is no discount for the story," he said. "The reality is once I am in the car there is no story any more and the job has to be done."It\'s not that I want to come back just to come back, because even if I get a chance and I don\'t feel confident or able to do it, I will not come back. There is no point. I am very demanding of myself."There are question marks that have to be answered for the team but also for myself. In general I see big improvements day by day so I can expect things getting better and that\'s why I say I would be disappointed because I am putting in a lot of effort and there is a good chance I am able to do it."But is that enough for Williams to make what is effectively a leap in the dark based on some apparently not-exactly-convincing lap times?Williams have said they are going to carefully analyse the results of the test before they make a decision on their line-up.If they decide not to go for Kubica, though, who do they pick?They have been clear that they want a driver with experience to replace Felipe Massa,  at the end of the season. And going back to the Brazilian and persuading him to come out of retirement a second year in a row is not an option.Sirotkin is rated highly at Renault, but has never raced in F1 and his record in the junior categories is solid rather than stellar. Three wins in the feeder GP2 category over two seasons in 2015-16; he was third in the championship both years.He brings some financial backing with him, but partnering him with Stroll would leave Williams with a very inexperienced driver line-up and lacking any sort of sense of whether the drivers were delivering close to the full potential of the car.In terms of experienced options, Williams have three choices - former Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat, Pascal Wehrlein, who drove for Sauber this year, and their own reserve driver Paul di Resta. All have pros and cons.Kvyat is regarded as very talented - but in the last two seasons he has been dropped twice by Red Bull, first from the senior team to  to make way for Max Verstappen and  before the end of this season, and finally sacked altogether.He would need some psychological building-up as a result of the knocks he has taken, and he is not believed to have much in the way of financial backing. But on the plus side he was not that far off the pace of Daniel Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz when he was their team-mate.Wehrlein\'s F1 career has so far been backed by Mercedes, Williams\' engine supplier, but Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff has made it pretty clear Wehrlein has to win any future seat on his own merit - saying in the summer he has to "stand on his own two feet" and in October that "wouldn\'t want to interfere" in Williams\' decision.Both Kvyat and Wehrlein also have the problem of being only 23 - and as Williams\' main sponsor is an alcohol brand, they ideally need a driver over 25 for their promotional campaigns.That leaves Di Resta. At 31, he is old enough, and he has three seasons\' experience in F1. But apart from a last-minute appearance as a sub for Massa in Hungary this year, he has not raced in a grand prix since 2013, when he was dropped by Force India. His F1 career was solid rather than spectacular. But then the same can be said for all the options bar Kubica.In 2018, Williams are entering a new era, with the first car designed under new technical leader Paddy Lowe, who was recruited after he left Mercedes at the end of last season.The bottom line is that Williams want to have the fastest driver available and someone who has potential to help the team build for the future.Their problem is that it is not clear who that is.']	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ['Formula 1 sporting boss Ross Brawn has defended plans to introduce a new, simpler, louder engine in 2021, saying: "We can\'t leave it as it is."F1 car manufacturers have objected  by the F1 Group and governing body the FIA.But Brawn, F1\'s managing director of motorsports, says it is necessary to safeguard the future of the sport."The current engine is an incredible piece of engineering but it\'s not a great racing engine," he said."It is very expensive, it doesn\'t make any noise, it has componentry that in order to control the number of uses is creating grid penalties that make a farce of F1, there are big differentials of performance between the competitors and we are never going to get anyone else to come in and make engines."He says he is not necessarily committed to any of the proposals he has put forward and is willing to discuss the issues with the four car manufacturers in F1 - Mercedes, Ferrari, Renault and Honda.Since 2014 F1 has used 1.6-litre V6 turbo engines with complex hybrid systems made up of two separate energy-recovery devices - the MGU-H on the turbo and the MGU-K on the rear axle.They have led to revolutionary progress in terms of thermal efficiency - the proportion of fuel energy that is converted into power - but have proved expensive, complex and unpopular with many fans because of their muted sound.Brawn says F1, the FIA and the teams set themselves a number of objectives for the new engine formula, which is to be introduced after 2020. The engines must be:The proposal made by the FIA and F1 was for the same basic architecture as the current engine but removing the MGU-H, introducing some standard parts and restrictions on components, and making the hybrid element driver-controllable to improve the racing.Mercedes and Renault have objected to this on the grounds that it constitutes a new engine and will incur significant development costs. Ferrari have complained about too much standardisation and threatened to pull out if the rules are not to their liking. Honda have not offered a public opinion.The car companies also objected to the announcement of the engine being so detailed, which they felt gave it the impression of a fait accompli.Brawn says he was "a little bit shocked at the response we\'ve had", because the manufacturers had all been involved in a series of meetings that led to the proposal."Reflecting on it, maybe we could have presented it differently," Brawn said. "But I didn\'t anticipate the response to be as strong as it was."We\'ve had another meeting since then and I\'ve made that comment. If that is the the thing people are most upset about, then I apologise. But let\'s not lose sight of what we are trying to do. If they were uncomfortable with the way it was presented, it wasn\'t intended that way."He says he is open-minded about potential solutions "as long as those principles that we\'ve set out are achieved".He added: "If a manufacturer can demonstrate that there is a better way of doing it than what has been proposed - i.e. it is cheaper, it is more appealing to the fans, it is something that a new supplier could engage with; any of those factors - then why not? "We are not wedded to specific solutions. We think with the expertise that we\'ve got and the work we\'ve done, these are the solutions that can work. "If somebody suggests another solution that they think will achieve the same objective, we are not going to say no."Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne reacted to the proposals by saying: "If we change the sandbox to the point it becomes unrecognisable, I don\'t want to play any more."He singled out "power-train uniqueness" as a non-negotiable for Ferrari.Brawn said: "I recognise it is important to keep the identity of a Ferrari or a Mercedes engine. They need to be able to say: \'That is our engine.\'"I don\'t think we have crossed that boundary but now the proposal is on the table we need to meet with these people and understand what it is they are comfortable with and what they are not."All the manufacturers like a large chunk of the proposal; it is just not the same chunk."The main objection of the manufacturers to the proposal is that it constitutes a new engine that incurs extra costs for them and provides no guarantee of attracting new entrants.Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said: "We must avoid developing a new engine concept that will trigger immense costs."Brawn says: "I accept it is a new engine but I think the economics of it will be justified."Wolff and Renault F1 boss Cyril Abiteboul have pointed out that they are being asked to commit to designing a new engine at a time when they do not know what commercial deals they are being offered for the period after 2020.There is also a growing sense of unease among the teams that the sport\'s owner, Liberty Media, is investing a lot of money in trying to promote F1 but that the costs of this are having an effect on the teams\' prize fund. The teams have not seen a detailed plan for the future of the sport, and are unconvinced by some of the small-scale changes that have been made or proposed by commercial boss Sean Bratches.There has also been a lack of clarity from Liberty as to the amount of prize money the teams can expect in future years, and concern that payments have gone down year-on-year for the third quarter in 2017 and are projected to decrease next season.Brawn said: "We need to convince the teams not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. "There is a bigger discussion on the whole commercial side that needs to take place. That is going to be fierce and tough but we have the technical, commercial and cost-control sides of the sport to try to push forward."If we spoil that because we are having this debate about the commercial side, we are foolish, because this makes the business better and more sustainable."For many years, people were critical about the lack of development of F1 on the commercial side - social media, looking after the fans, all sorts of stuff."And now we are doing it, it is going to have a price. There will be an impact to make those investments and get the thing rolling and in my view that investment will pay off in the next few years."It will improve. We are conscious of the need to make sure the teams have more predictability of what the numbers are."Abiteboul said he believed an independent engine company would still need to attract external financing to produce an engine under the new rules - a point with which Britain\'s Ilmor and Cosworth concur.But Brawn said: "It\'s still an achievable project. A sponsor could be a manufacturer, or it could be a commercial entity that wants its name on an engine in F1. At the moment, it\'s not viable for anyone to come into F1. I believe we can create an environment where it becomes viable."He said one of the main triggers for introducing a different engine was to end the problem of engine-related penalties - there have been about 700 grid-place penalties so far this season."I don\'t know how to get out of that with the current engine because the componentry is very expensive and the idea was that by limiting the number of components we\'d keep costs down and avoid wastage," he said.The current engine formula was introduced by the FIA in an attempt to make F1 more relevant to technologies in road cars but Brawn says: "The technology has become very exclusive and elusive and I don\'t think it\'s the right solution for the sport.""The FIA has recognised that having the ultimate technology is perhaps too high a price, even in F1," Brawn said."It has recognised there has to be a balance between between road-relevance, technology and what is the most sensible engine to have in F1 because the costs of the engine have got so high."He adds that the MGU-H had so far not transferred into passenger road cars and is mainly being used in commercial vehicles.One senior figure at one of F1\'s engine manufacturers said that the MGU-H was unlikely to be used in everyday road cars but could have some use in high-performance sportscars. Mercedes has recently revealed a supercar that contains a full F1 engine as the powertrain.There has also been confusion as to why Brawn, as a representative of the F1 Group, is suggesting rule changes, which are traditionally the remit of the FIA.Brawn says F1 and the FIA are "working together on" the engine proposal."We\'ve become involved," he said. "I felt we always should be involved and we have added to the capacity for the FIA to analyse and regulate the sport."The working parties in this and other areas are pretty much joined at the hip."

CONTENT:  ['The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix ended the Formula 1 season with a whimper rather than a bang, and perhaps that was appropriate for a year that for a long time was building into a classic, only to fizzle out when it mattered.Lewis Hamilton did not have quite enough to  on a track where racing has always been notoriously difficult, and had to settle for second behind the Finn, as the world champions sealed a result that was about as perfect for the team as it could have been.Waiting to go out on to the podium afterwards, Hamilton expressed what everyone had been thinking: "Impossible to pass here, man," he said to Bottas and third-placed Sebastian Vettel. "I was like, \'Where are all the friggin\' back markers?\' I think they\'ve got to change this track."It was a grand prix that once again underlined the flaws in holding the  at a place that has a lot going for it as a pleasant destination where everything works and the weather is reliable, and not much as a venue for a great motor race. But it - and the weekend in general - also highlighted some of the issues facing the sport as a whole.There was some suspicion after the race that perhaps Hamilton had not been pushing as hard against his team-mate as he might have been had it been Vettel in front of him, but he dismissed that afterwards.Bottas said that Hamilton had told him during the team\'s post-race briefing that he had been pushing as hard as he could and the Briton confirmed that shortly afterwards."To get as close as I was showed I had good pace," Hamilton said, "but when you get to within 1.1-1.2secs the car just loses grip. I did a lot of rallying today."Hamilton did indeed have good pace; he took 0.7secs out of Bottas on his first flying lap after his pit stop, but the Finn always did just enough to hold him off.Hamilton was somewhat confused as to how he came out behind after his pit stop on lap 24, having been told he was 1.7secs up before it, but the key to that was Bottas setting a new fastest lap, fully 0.8secs faster than he had been on the previous tour.After that, the difficulties created by a track that has two long straights to facilitate overtaking, but wrecks it by then having a twisty final sector that features corner after corner that accentuates the fundamental flaws of the current F1 cars."A race like today is not the best advert for Formula 1," said Red Bull team boss Christian Horner. "We\'re better than that. Of course, it\'s only one event and there have been some great races this year."The drivers warned before the season that the new rules, which  with much more downforce, would make overtaking more difficult, and they have returned to the point over and over again during the season.They are right, of course. But on balance F1 2017 has been a step forward over the years that immediately preceded it.The wider cars - back to the size they were before they were narrowed for the 1998 season - have returned F1 machines to the muscular proportions that made them so attractive before that. The cars are not only more dramatic but visibly faster and more exciting to watch, both for aficionados and casual fans.Their greater speed - cornering speeds are up by about 20mph in the faster corners - has returned the joy of driving back to the men who do it, and who are the reason most of the fans tune in to watch in the first place.The wider tyres have also helped the aesthetics, and supplier Pirelli has more or less met its targets in producing tyres that have allowed the drivers to push much harder throughout races.That in itself has made the racing much more authentic, which has been one of the biggest single improvements this season. Watching a grand prix, one now knows that these are the best drivers in the world driving the fastest cars more or less as fast as they can go, rather than tootling about lapping seconds off the pace to manage stint lengths as they had been from 2011-16.The tyres are not perfect - they still require a little too much thermal management, and they could do with being softer, as long as that does not mean losing their push-on characteristics - but as a first step in the right direction it has been a major positive.On top of better, faster cars, and more race-able tyres there has been - or at least was for the majority of the season - a full-on title battle between two great drivers in two different teams.For 13 of the 20 races, Hamilton v Vettel, Mercedes v Ferrari was shaping up to be one of the all-time great fights.Four race wins each in the first half of the season, the two were separated by just three points after the Italian Grand Prix in early September. Then, as has been well-documented on this site already, Ferrari imploded and handed the title on a plate to Hamilton.It would have been a lot closer had Vettel not had his red-mist moment of driving into Hamilton in Baku, his start-line pile-up in Singapore and the engine problems that cost him a net total of nearly 40 points in Malaysia and Japan.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        The way Mercedes - and particularly Hamilton - have stepped things up in the second part of the season suggests that in the end the titles would have gone the way they did. But Mercedes\' advantage in Abu Dhabi was flattered by Ferrari\'s decision to turn down Vettel\'s engine to ensure he finished the race and clinched second in the championship, and it will forever remain a mystery what would have happened had Vettel and Ferrari been as consistent and reliable a partnership as Hamilton and Mercedes throughout the season.Vettel said: "Overall we were not quick enough. Simple as that. In the end you can break it down to a lot of details and this and that but overall the package wasn\'t good enough."In the end Mercedes was better, they were faster - look at the amount of pole positions, of race wins.  It\'s a straight fight and they just did better but again I want to emphasise the positives for us. "The positives outweigh the disappointments we had here and there over the year, because you must not forget where we have been 12 months ago and the incredible achievement that\'s come together over the winter to set up this year, and throughout the season to keep improving the car, the engine."If we keep doing that I\'m confident that we can be in a better place next year."On the face of it, 2018 should provide another close fight between Mercedes and Ferrari. There is a slight concern that if Mercedes iron out the weakness of what team boss Toto Wolff calls their "capricious diva" of a car, they might become dominant again. But the rules are staying stable, bar a few minor tweaks, and one would expect based on the pattern of the season the two teams to make similar progress over the winter and Wolff seems to agree. "We did not expect Ferrari this year and from the get-go they had a very good car, so we mustn\'t discount anybody," he said. "Today it looks like it will be Ferrari and Red Bull (as the main rivals) but I am curious to see where McLaren and Renault are going to come out as the teams that have the resources. But I wouldn\'t want to write anybody else off because the rules stay the same so it could be a very competitive season."Before then, there is a winter to get through. The teams will be hard at work on their new cars, but their bosses will be just as busy dealing with the growing political tensions in F1.The  have made a lot of changes this season - including actually trying to market F1 for the first time, opening up social media, making the fan experience better and, on Sunday, launching a new logo that they feel better fits the digital age than the one that has served F1 for 23 years.But that is just window-dressing on the wider issues, over which concern is growing among the teams. Revenue is dropping next year. And Liberty are not making any friends with the ways they are handling some of the bigger questions. There is a row brewing over the  and the sport\'s biggest television market - Germany - does not yet have a free-to-air broadcaster in 2018 because RTL is yet to renew its contract. Another major market - the UK - is losing its free TV in a year\'s time.Teams accept the new owners needs to invest to grow, but are clearly expecting revenues to go back up again in a couple of years. Meanwhile, they are complaining about a slightly haphazard approach to some of the changes they are trying to introduce - even if it is with the best intentions. And while the drivers support the plan to look at the design of the cars to make it easier to follow and overtake, they feel that the fact that it was their idea in the first place has been somewhat forgotten. Leading drivers were really quite cross about the fact that F1 sporting boss Ross Brawn made a presentation to them on Friday in Abu Dhabi on his plans to look at the cars\' design, but made no acknowledgement whatsoever of the drivers\' own involvement in the process.Meanwhile, the F1 Group has still not provided any detail on its plans for the future despite nearly a year of saying that they have lots of them.Commercial boss Sean Bratches was asked to provide more information as he launched the new logo, but his response was dismissive."The opportunity Liberty saw when they invested in the sport was one that was under-managed and under-invested in," he said. "We had to make an investment today for the future. "Notwithstanding certain select comments in the press, I think the teams directionally understand that F1 needs investment, and we are having many conversations. From a general standpoint, they are optimistic in terms of what the opportunities are and it\'s early in the game."We have accomplished a significant amount in terms of building an organisation and starting the process. This is a journey and not a destination. We have great aspirations for this sport. "It is not something you just flick a switch and things happen. Things need to be invested in and nourished and brought to market. "You will continue to see a cadence of announcements and changes. There is more to come. We are working on those plans but we are not going to sit here right now and enumerate our visions for the sport."We are working hard and when we have something to announce, we will let you know, but I can assure you we are working 24/7 to make this sport as great as it can be because we believe there is a great opportunity."There is a meeting scheduled next month at which Liberty say they will give the teams information on their next steps. They will have to do better than that if the natives are not to grow increasingly restless.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['Sebastian Vettel was "let down" by his emotions in his title fight with Lewis Hamilton in 2017, according to Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.The German Ferrari driver appears "calm", but "is very emotional and passionate under the skin".Wolff added: "This has made him win championships in the past. This year, it has let him down."Lewis by contrast has grown as a personality and as a driver and outside the car and that made him very strong."Wolff\'s remarks, in an exclusive interview for the BBC 5 live Formula 1 review show, were a reference to two key incidents that affected Vettel\'s championship campaign.The first was in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when  provoked by his erroneous belief that Hamilton had given him a \'brake test\'.The second was the start-line crash in Singapore,  that took out both Ferraris, Red Bull\'s Max Verstappen and McLaren\'s Fernando Alonso.The incidents cost Vettel at least 30 points in what had been until Singapore a tight battle with Hamilton.On Baku, Wolff said: "We immediately looked at the data to see whether you could see something like a brake test and we couldn\'t see any of that. "But Sebastian\'s emotion and anger just ran away with him in that moment. He would be the first one to acknowledge if he could turn back time, he wouldn\'t do it again."And about Singapore Wolff said: "I don\'t know whether it was pressure or not. Sebastian knew that in order to score 25 points (for a win) in Singapore, he needs to lead the race after the start. And he tried to come in strong and with the lack of visibility in these cars he just triggered a chain reaction."\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Wolff\'s remarks were echoed by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: "Why (was Vettel) always moaning and bitching? He is getting more nasty all the time and why is he so emotional? He was never that bad before. "Emotions in his way distracted - this is my opinion - him from really driving quick and focusing on the real battles."Vettel said: "The one that stands out that I messed up was probably the Baku thing, which wasn\'t necessary. We lost some points there. "Did it make a difference? I don\'t think it matters. Looking back it is the fact I let the team down, and it didn\'t gain us anything but other than that we had a very strong year. "Things, to be fair, here and there didn\'t come together."Stuff like Singapore cost us massively but that sort of stuff happens. If you stop racing you might as well quit. The intention was never to not finish the race but sometimes these things happen. The other races overall we got more or less what was in the car."Hamilton and Vettel will both be aiming to become a five-time world champion next season, and Wolff expects the fight to be even closer than it was for most of 2017 because it will be the  that introduced faster and more demanding cars this season."The longer a regulation stays stable the more everybody closes up," Wolff said, "and for me it was already pretty close at many races."So one thing is for sure it is going to be an even more tough fight next year against Red Bull and Ferrari and maybe some other team during the season and we are all up for the challenge."Wolff said Mercedes hoped to iron out some of the deficiencies that made their cars "difficult" at some races in 2017, where they were out-paced by Ferrari and Red Bull, but added that they would be unlikely to fully succeed."We have an understanding (of the car\'s problems) and we are trying to implement it into the new car," he said. "Having said that, every car has a certain DNA and I don\'t think you want and will have a car that is strong on 21 circuits next year but in the end it has to be strong on most circuits."\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Wolff and Hamilton are in the process of trying to agree a new contract to keep the four-time world champion at Mercedes beyond his current deal, which The Austrian said: "Of course he has it in him to want to be the very best and outscore all the results but equally he is a \'frei-geist\' - a free spirit - and he wants to keep his options open whether he stays a racing driver in 2019 or becomes a fashion entrepreneur."But he insisted that both team and driver wanted to stay together after next season."We are in negotiations about a new long-term contract and hopefully Lewis can stay with us for many more years," he said. "This is the wish of all the parties. He wants to be with us and we would like to keep him obviously but at the same time I think he just needs to have the peace of mind that whatever he decides to do in the future he can do. "At the moment, he loves F1 and he doesn\'t want to do anything else and all the rest is hobbies but maybe in two or three or four years down the line he changes."Assuming Hamilton stays beyond 2018, Wolff will have to decide who to sign as his team-mate.His current team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who joined Mercedes for 2017, is one option, but Red Bull\'s Daniel Ricciardo is also out of contract, while Force India\'s Esteban Ocon is a Mercedes young driver and had a very impressive first full season this year.Wolff said the relationship between Hamilton and Bottas this year had made him reappraise what was required after four years of poisonous atmosphere between Hamilton and Nico Rosberg."If you would have asked me the question one year ago I would have said having Lewis and Nico, two drivers who have a strong rivalry and are pushing each other and making the car faster," Wolff said."But we have realised that the positive dynamics we had between Valtteri and Lewis in a difficult season like we had in 2017, was an asset. "In so far as I would like the pairing to continue, we are committed to both of them in 2018 but having said that 2019 is a very exciting new year. "There are young drivers that will have gained more experience and some of the very good ones like Daniel become free. "And what we want to see is how the first third of the season pans out, whether our car is good enough and strong enough, and this is what we are actually concentrating on and then we will analyse and then take the right decisions hopefully."The Williams team, which uses Mercedes engines, has still to finalise its driver line-up for 2018.Russian Sergey Sirotkin is the favourite for the seat despite never having raced in F1, after testing with Williams\' first choice, the former BMW Sauber and Renault driver Robert Kubica, proved inconclusive.But Wolff believes Williams should have gone a different route and signed one of the highly regarded rising stars such as Mercedes protege George Russell, McLaren\'s reserve driver Lando Norris or Formula 2 champion Charles Leclerc, who will be at Sauber next year.Wolff, who was a former shareholder and senior figure at Williams before moving to Mercedes in 2013, said: "If I were Williams today I would be bold and would put a George Russell or a Lando Norris in the car or Leclerc - one of these really bright talented kids who have won championships in the past to develop the next superstar."But having said that there is a financial reality they live in and they have to find the right compromise."']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['Williams are close to signing Sergey Sirotkin as the final piece of the 2018 grid falls into place.The team are finalising a contract with the 22-year-old, who established his credentials in a test in Abu Dhabi after the end of last season.The Russian, who has a reported budget of €15m (£13.3m), was faster than rival Robert Kubica after the team had fully analysed all the data from the test.Sirotkin and Lance Stroll would be the least experienced line-up on the grid.Sirotkin will be making his F1 debut as partner to a 19-year-old who has raced for only one season.Williams had been intending to sign Kubica for a return to F1 seven years after the Pole suffered life-changing injuries in a rally crash in February 2011.But the team\'s interest in the 32-year-old cooled after he tested their 2017 car in Abu Dhabi alongside Sirotkin.Sirotkin has a bigger budget than Kubica by a factor of about two, but the team insist the decision is primarily performance-based.Although there is understood to be no impediment to the Sirotkin-Williams deal, no announcement is expected for at least the next 10 days as the team take their time to complete the details of the contract.Meanwhile, Canadian Nicolas Latifi has joined Force India as test and reserve driver for the 2018 Formula 1 season.The 22-year-old will take part in what the team say are "a number" of Friday practice sessions, as well as the two official \'young driver\' tests this year.Latifi - who finished fifth in Formula Two last season, winning one race - said: "I\'m really excited about the opportunity and eager to show the team what I can do."The Toronto native, who brings with him to Force India a significant budget, has previously been linked to a similar role at Williams.Latifi is also expected to do another year of F2 alongside his F1 commitments.It will be his fifth season in the category, which changed its name from GP2 to F2 last year.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        ']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['It\'s all very quiet in Formula 1 at the moment, at least in public-facing terms. You may have noticed this. But then there\'s Lewis Hamilton and the strange case of his vanishing social media posts.Over the Christmas period, the world champion found himself at the centre of a storm after posting on Instagram a video of his young nephew wearing a pink dress, and Hamilton saying: "Boys don\'t wear princess dresses."The video was posted on Christmas Day. Hamilton was widely criticised. An Then, over the next day or so, all the posts Hamilton had ever put on  and  disappeared. They were systematically deleted over a period of several hours. Although his  appears untouched.As yet, no one outside Hamilton\'s close circle of friends and advisers knows why, or what that means.Has Hamilton disappeared from social media for good? If so, why keep the accounts open? But if he hasn\'t, why delete the posts? Was this a fit of pique following a torrent of online criticism for what was interpreted in some quarters as him admonishing his nephew for wearing a dress?I don\'t have an answer to these questions. In fact, I would hazard a guess that there will never be a clear one.Investigations over the last few days have, though, revealed a few pieces of information.Firstly, Hamilton has apparently not disappeared from social media for good. It was, I\'m told, always the plan of Hamilton and his advisory team to empty his "social channels" this winter; the idea being to make a fresh start in 2018.Several questions, however, remain unanswered: Why the perceived need for a clean slate? Why now and not any other year? Is it to stop media trawling through his social media history for posts and using them to illustrate stories? And was the deletion and/or its timing anything to do with the controversy over the \'princess dress\' video?An adviser to Hamilton told BBC Sport: "We have no comment to make on this. We really don\'t think taking a break from social media during the holidays is newsworthy."If that\'s all it was, it wouldn\'t be. Except, of course, what Hamilton has done is rather more than "take a break" - he has actively sought to wipe his entire social media history. For a sportsman who has been at the forefront of the use of social media, has 5.3 million followers on Twitter and 5.7m on Instagram, who has used it to give fans an insight into his life, and who has occasionally caused himself trouble as a result, that is news, whether Hamilton likes it or not.There are two other issues with that response - it does not actually address the questions at issue; and it ignores the fact that the media decides what is newsworthy, not the people whom the news is about.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        What has any of this got to do with sport, you might well ask? Well, potentially, not a huge amount perhaps, at least on the surface. The \'princess dress\' controversy is a \'News\' story, not a \'Sport\' story - in that it is about Hamilton\'s life away the track, not at it, and touches social, political and cultural issues that go way beyond what he does for a living.But these things have a tendency to spill over into people\'s professional lives.One person close to Hamilton says that all this will all go away once he publishes his first social media entry post-deletion. It might - but only if he addresses what he has done on Twitter and Instagram in deleting his posts, and why.If not, the strong likelihood is that his first official news conference for his Mercedes team following the winter will be at least partly about this non-sporting matter.If it is, it will likely go one of two ways. Either Hamilton will address it head on, deal with it, and everyone can move on. Or he will become defensive, stonewall it, and it could fester. Ultimately, this might not matter. But in the past sometimes it has. For all his global profile and superstar status, Hamilton is a sensitive soul and he does not take kindly to public criticism. Who does, to be fair? But it\'s not that long ago that Hamilton allowed extraneous - and largely irrelevant - off-track issues such as this to distract from what happened on it.The most recent was the 2016 Japanese Grand Prix, which immediately followed the race in Malaysia, where Hamilton made some controversial comments about an engine failure that left his title hopes In the days following, Hamilton posted a message on his Instagram feed which appeared aimed at damage limitation. Then, at a pre-event news conference in Japan, rather than answer questions fully, Hamilton repeatedly referred journalists to that entry. And he spent the rest of the time putting cartoon animal faces on fellow driver Carlos Sainz on another social media outlet, Snapchat.He was criticised in some media outlets for that. Two days later, not long after being beaten to pole position by team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg, he made a speech at the start of a second news conference saying he had been disrespected, and walked out saying he would not answer questions.The next day, Hamilton made a terrible start from the front row and Rosberg cruised to victory in a race in which beating the German was Hamilton\'s last chance to keep the destiny of that year\'s championship within his own control.Rosberg was loving it - rightly or wrongly, he perceived what his team-mate was up to off track as a needless distraction that was affecting Hamilton\'s performance and playing into his hands.There is no reason why this latest social media snafu should affect Hamilton in the same way. There is plenty of time between now and the start of the season for this all to settle down. It may all turn out to be nothing. But it may not.

I can barely remember the last few days. There have been some very special laps, though.Monza was very tough. I was really surprised that the others (were so far away)… Malaysia; it was a real surprise to be on pole there. I\'d have to go and look at them (to give a definitive answer) because there are ones that felt better than others. Individually, they have not felt the same. Malaysia, for example, I thought: "I\'m probably not going to get pole today but I\'m going to give it everything anyway." Then somehow you hook up a lap. Because there were moments in that lap where there were drifts and you just held onto it and somehow hit the apex, still the drift, it actually set you up - which you weren\'t planning but you take it.They brought exactly what I expected - worse racing. I didn\'t really have an expectation. But they\'ve been a big step in the right direction, much more enjoyable. Another step like this would be good - and bring some of the noise back. There\'s some great qualities of it but we need to put better bits in. For example, following (other cars) this year has been worse, naturally. They (F1\'s bosses) know the issues and I think they should utilise us (the drivers) and speak to us. Some of these guys - every guy, most likely - that\'s on the board haven\'t driven an F1 car and don\'t know why it\'s so hard to get past. But they\'re also very smart and know stuff we don\'t. Pouhon at Spa - the high-speed corners this year have been, phwoar. The best corners of the season are generally Austin - Turns Three-Four-Five-Six-Seven. They are awesome. Silverstone - Copse and then Maggotts and Becketts. Suzuka - the Esses. They are the special ones. For some reason Austin is the best set-up because there are different lines you can take within that. Suzuka, it is very hard to have a different line and race. That\'s why I love Austin. Somehow the layout; I don\'t think they planned it but it\'s enabled it to be a track you can overtake on. It\'s one of my favourite tracks, actually, and I don\'t like new tracks usually. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        It\'s difficult to describe. It\'s like trying to describe how you felt when the baby came out. The exciting thing is being on the limit. It\'s getting out there and discovering the limit faster than everyone else and then when you get to that limit, playing with the limit. Then balancing on the edge. Controlling it. I love that.For sure. That\'s part of the discovery through practice. Which is how you see often in qualifying I can pull out a little bit more. You keep those things. I love the qualifying because you\'re always trying to pull out another card. You can\'t always do it. Yeah, but I want that. The problem is you build yourself. The human body\'s quite remarkable because you can build the strength. So make the cars another three seconds faster; it\'s going to be a challenge but F1 should push you so much to the limit physically. I love that. That\'s where we should be. I hope we move more in that direction.The tyres are not so forgiving. Back then, there was a lot less aero(dynamic grip), more mechanical. Which I think is what we need. It\'s like karting. With karting you don\'t have (tyre) degradation. And with all the aero on the cars, you get that slide, and you often can\'t get the heat out of the tyre (afterwards). The key is to keep temperatures down, minimise wheelspin. Any slip you have... it feels good but you know it\'s going to affect you two corners later. The FIA have done an amazing job but they\'ve really got to stop with these run-off areas. You shouldn\'t be able to cut a corner like you see. What I love about the olden days - of course you don\'t want to crash, but if you go wide, you\'ve got to lose time. But now you can approach a corner knowing that if you go in 5% too much you can go wide and come back on. I don\'t love that. Other tracks I used to love were Oulton Park and Donington Park. Donington - the Old Hairpin was a nightmare. You have to come off the brakes and run the speed in, use the downforce. Then up the hill and the second right-hander before the back straight (Coppice). You can\'t even see the white line. There is a white line and then gravel and the gravel sucks you off - oh man.Finding the limit there, that corner is way harder than all the corners in F1. That\'s the sort of corner F1 is missing. If we had that back in F1, it would bring another level to the challenge. I do have more energy but before I had more than enough energy anyway. I just feel cleaner. I don\'t feel bogged down, don\'t have problems with my stomach like I used to have, just feel cleaner. It\'s hard to stay on the diet I\'m on. Not at all the temptation. It\'s actually really weird, once you get across that side. The other day I was at dinner and my friends were eating meat and I look at it and I\'m disgusted and I used to love meat. \n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        I actually wouldn\'t go. I was invited to a meal recently and I said: \'Look, I\'m really trying to stick to his diet I\'m on and I don\'t believe in supporting that restaurant.\'Struggling in finding foods that you love as much as foods you used to love is what it is. I live on salads. I have a lot more carbs now, which is weird because before I had cut my carbs completely and had a high protein diet but now I\'m on salads, a lot of breads, pancakes. So some things are really enjoyable but I\'m still discovering. It does change your life. But I feel the best I\'ve ever felt. I met people, friends who were vegans, who exposed me to some of the things that were happening that I was completely oblivious to. It affected me so much when I saw these things (that meat-eating does). So bit by bit I weaned off it. Came off red meat two and a half years ago, stopped eating chicken at the beginning of this year and was pescatarian. Then the final thing was seeing this one documentary. I\'d seen a couple, but this one was, \'OK, I\'m done\'.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['Red Bull reject Daniil Kvyat has been signed by Ferrari as their development driver.The 23-year-old Russian\'s role will primarily involve work in the Italian team\'s simulator. There are no plans for Kvyat to test the car on track.Kvyat, who was finally  after being demoted twice within 18 months, joins a large driver roster at Ferrari.The team retained Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen as race drivers in 2018.Should either of them be unable to race, Ferrari have a number of options.Prime among them would likely be Monegasque Charles Leclerc, a Ferrari protege who is to make his Formula 1 debut for Sauber this season.Leclerc has been identified as the most likely successor to Raikkonen as Vettel\'s number two.The veteran Finn is considered to be on his last chance at Ferrari after several lacklustre seasons and sources close to the team say Leclerc will replace him in 2019 as long as the 20-year-old Formula Two champion\'s development goes as expected this season.Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne said at the team\'s Christmas lunch: "When things go right, it\'s a pleasure to see [Raikkonen] driving. In other moments it seems like he takes a break."He needs more consistency in terms of performance, but it\'s important to find the right key to make him driving like in Monaco also on other circuits."Probably this is the last season to find the right key and we must do it. I think it would be a shame if he left F1 without showing his real potential."Marchionne added: "We see Leclerc, [Red Bull\'s Max] Verstappen and [Antonio] Giovinazzi, drivers with great skills, who can deliver a big change in the driver market. I\'m still happy to have chosen Leclerc."I think that if we cannot find the right key for Raikkonen, the choice will fall on a young driver."Italian Giovinazzi, 24, was Ferrari\'s reserve and third driver last season but this year has a similar role with Sauber, having been leapfrogged in the pecking order by Leclerc.Sauber has effectively become a Ferrari satellite team this year and is carrying branding for the marque\'s sister company Alfa Romeo, which is to have high-profile involvement in F1 for the first time since 1985.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

We simply cannot go on with a pattern where teams go away and get hammered and then sweep things under the carpet once they get back home and begin winning again in conditions that suit them.It's not just England - most countries do it with their pitches, with the exception of Australia. Test cricket needs closer contests though because it's part of the interesting cycle of the calendar that teams must adapt to new conditions.That also means drawing a line under this tit-for-tat, zero quality preparation that touring teams are given these days.Hopefully now this has reached the depths whereby administrators realise they have to give teams proper practice and preparation.Otherwise touring teams are going to keep get hammered, which is totally against the interests of Test cricket.There's a pattern developing - there's no chance to restore confidence, no chance to restore form, no chance to get players who aren't playing in a Test match into any sort of condition or form and that has got to stop.Touring teams must be given appropriate amounts of warm-up matches against opposition of a decent standard.Following the limited-overs leg of their tour down under, England will travel to New Zealand for two Test matches in March.I actually think England in New Zealand will be a very good contest because Kane Williamson's side have an excellent new-ball attack.The conditions will be more to their liking but New Zealand won't be a pushover.England's inability to turn fifties into hundreds was crucial in their defeat in Australia.Australia scored nine hundreds to England's three and there were too many failures from their experienced players.Joe Root didn't score a century in the series and Alastair Cook scored 132 runs in the eight innings either side of his albeit magnificent 244 not out in the fourth Test in Melbourne.There was always a question about James Vince's selection - we talked about that before a ball was bowled.While he looks pretty at times and played one or two nice innings, he's just not got the technique to cope with Test-class bowling around his off stump.That, I'm afraid, was a gamble that didn't work. We might see Dawid Malan move up to number three in New Zealand. That would make sense to me because he has potential and looks more suited to that role than anyone else we've seen in the past 12 months.Similarly, there were positives in the debut of Craig Overton in Australia. He looks to be a good, decent professional.Again, though, I think he is someone who will bowl well in England but lack penetration elsewhere.We have talked a lot about the lack of pace in their bowling attack and that was evident all series.England have got to encourage a system in which they produce fast bowlers. They have got to take bowlers with pace to countries like Australia.You can't have 82-83mph bowlers rolling up there with a Kookaburra ball and expect to get decent players out. It's not going to happen.It's easy to throw mud at coaches because we don't see - nor often understand - everything they do.However, if ever there was a case for a coach doing his job it was when Jonny Bairstow went out without a nightwatchman in Sydney.That was just a common sense decision at that particular time.I'm not always a fan of the nightwatchman. I used to do it and hated the job and there were times when I thought it was unnecessary and just a batsman that was hiding.However, there are times when it is essential for the team that you don't lose a frontline batsman and that was the case in Sydney in England's first innings when a new ball was taken.Joe Root had just been dismissed in the penultimate over of the day, and it was an absolute bang-to-rights case of needing a nightwatchman.The coach should have said 'sit down Jonny... Jimmy Anderson get out there and bat'. That should have been the end of it, there should be no argument.That was a case where I thought the coach got it wrong."]	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ['Few cricketers can have been so at home making a Test debut in a foreign country as England\'s Mason Crane at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Less than a year ago, the 20-year-old performed so well in his time with Sydney club Gordon that he was called up to play for New South Wales in the last first-class match to be held at the SCG.And if there are some comforts for a young leg-spinner who has so far conceded 1-135 bowling for the first time in Test cricket on this ground - such as Shane Warne returning 1-150 on debut in Sydney - then there are others he should ignore. England handed a cap to Scott Borthwick in the final Ashes Test here four years ago - and he has not been picked since.The Hampshire man\'s first few days of Test cricket have been nothing if not eventful.He was padded up to be nightwatchman on the first evening, only for Jonny Bairstow to go to the middle and be out by the time the day was done. He was then run out in a mix-up with James Anderson on the second morning, all before getting the ball in hand for the first time.If that opening day of bowling was impressive, full of near-misses rather than clear chances, The chance to have Usman Khawaja caught and bowled was missed by a blade or two of grass. Later in the same over, an lbw decision and a maiden wicket was denied because there was no shoe leather behind the popping crease.When Crane returned later, the advancing Khawaja was beaten by a leg-break that turned between bat and pad. When Bairstow removed the bails, Crane wheeled away in a fist-pumping celebration.For Crane, that maiden Test wicket came on the ground where he spent hours in the nets with former Australia leg-spinner Stuart MacGill last winter.In those twice-weekly sessions, arranged by the England and Wales Cricket Board\'s spin-bowling scholarship, Crane may have unwittingly picked up his mentor\'s mannerisms - the long, bounding run-up, or the towel tucked into the waistband of the trousers on the left hip."I know that MacGill drums into bowlers to approach every ball in exactly the same way," said Andrew Falk, the Gordon scorer with whom Crane lived during his time in Sydney. "You get into a routine. Stop, turn around, think about what you\'re doing."The philosophy is that if you keep doing the same things, you might lower the chance of a bad delivery when you spot that you are not about to land in the right place, or get your arm up, or whatever it might be."Sure enough, MacGill\'s teachings were revealed throughout Crane\'s first bowl in Test cricket. Time and again he would pull out of his action, even if that meant drawing boos from the crowd."If something doesn\'t feel quite right when I\'m running in, I stop myself rather than bowling a ball that wouldn\'t be as good as I can give," he explained.For Crane, time with MacGill in Sydney was the continuation of a cricketing education that could have ended when he was not chosen for the under-14 side of Sussex, the county of his birth, because of his batting and fielding.He was put back on the right track at Lancing College by Raj Maru, the former Hampshire and Middlesex spinner, who alerted Hampshire to Crane\'s talents.Crane made his debut for the county in 2015, claiming Sri Lanka great Kumar Sangakkara as his first wicket. It was former Hampshire team-mate Will Smith, once of Gordon, that recommended Crane to the Sydney side."We made him a better player, but we haven\'t created the cricketer," said Gordon wicketkeeper Ash Doolan. "We helped him out as a person."He\'s a good kid. He arrived prim and proper, but an only child that was fresh from home."And so, while Crane was learning in the nets from MacGill, he got a different kind of education in the suburb that is a half-hour drive to the north of Sydney city centre. "His dad is a hairdresser and no-one else had ever given him a haircut," said Doolan. "It took him two and a half months to go to get one while he was here."I took him to the local barber and he just wanted a short back and sides, but it took him about an hour and a half to work out what he needed. He had to phone his dad in England to find out."\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        From the barber\'s, to the beach. "He wanted to go to the beach, but his body didn\'t allow it," added Doolan. "He was probably the palest of the English players we\'ve had here in the past 10 years."He used a whole bottle of sunscreen, then sat in the sand with no towel. His whole body was covered in sand."When it came to going into the water, he thought he was made of sugar and that if you jump into a bath over here you\'ll get eaten by a shark."There were domestic teething problems, too."It wasn\'t that he didn\'t want to change the toilet roll," said Falk. "I just don\'t think he\'d ever had to do it before."His room looked like a bomb site. He had a big, double-sided suitcase. He opened that up when he arrived and I don\'t think it ever moved until the day he left."I loved having him in the house, though. He was well-mannered and appreciative of anything that we did for him."As the Gordon players educated Crane off the field, he helped them on it. They ended the season as the joint-premiers, the table-toppers. When they went through to play in the semi-finals, they were beaten in Crane\'s absence.At one stage, Crane returned three consecutive seven-wicket hauls, a run of form that prompted the call-up to the New South Wales side for their final home game of the season. He became the first overseas player to represent the state in the Sheffield Shield since Pakistan great Imran Khan."By the end of the season, we knew we\'d see him again," said club captain Tym Crawford. "It was just a matter of if he\'d be playing for us or touring with England."A call-up to the Ashes squad settled that, but Crane remained in touch with Gordon. He is still part of the club\'s Facebook group, commenting on results and performances each week, and he met up with Falk and his team-mates in the run-up to the Sydney Test."We all take on adventures in life," said Doolan. "Coming to play for us was Mason\'s first big one."It\'s a credit to him how he treats the friends that he made here. He\'ll be connected to us for the rest of his life."\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        ']	 CATEGORY:Sports

CONTENT:  ['Not long after England last won the Ashes in Australia, Trevor Bayliss was working as an estate agent.Deciding to leave his post with Sri Lanka after he led them to the 2011 World Cup final, he applied for his old job as New South Wales coach and was overlooked.Unemployed, he was invited to try his hand at selling houses in Penrith, west of Sydney, by family friend Michael Ball."He\'s not a silly man, but he had to go and do courses to be licensed to buy and sell houses," Ball tells BBC Sport."He was very successful because he is a people person. The beauty is that the clients wouldn\'t have had a clue who he was. It wasn\'t until afterwards that they knew. "I still have clients now, who dealt with Trevor, asking if he\'s the England cricket coach."By working in Penrith, the suburb at the foot of the Blue Mountains that he still calls home, Bayliss was back in the community he first encountered in 1982.A talented young batsman, he moved from rural Goulburn at the age of 19 to test himself in Sydney\'s notoriously tough grade cricket system.His ties to Penrith Panthers Cricket Club run deep. He is their all-time record run-scorer and their annual batting award bears his name.In the year that Bayliss found himself out of professional cricket, Penrith\'s annual report read: "This season saw the return of one of Penrith\'s favourite sons, Trevor Bayliss, back closer to the club as first-grade coach. Glad you\'re back, Trevor."In his early days at Penrith, Bayliss lived with club president Bill Ball, sharing a room with fellow batsman Brian Wood."We shared a tiny little room with about two feet between the bed, so we had to get on," says Wood."He was a bloody good cricketer and a good leader. We copped a lot of sledging because we had baby faces and were very young. "Geoff Lawson (the fast bowler who played 46 Tests for Australia) said to him \'we\'re playing Green Shield today\', Green Shield being the under-16 competition."On another day, Lenny Pascoe (14 Tests) was bouncing the crap out of us and Trevor kept hitting him out of the ground. Lenny sledged him more and Trevor kept hitting him further, without saying anything back."He had the mental capacity to weather a storm and come out the other side. By golly, he had the intestinal fortitude that made you know he was not backing down. He was mentally tough, a hard man."We used to get a few bob off the Penrith club for how many runs we got. When we hit a four, we used to say to each other \'cash, cash, cash\'."It was while living in Penrith that Bayliss met future wife Julie, with Wood a groomsman at the wedding in Goulburn."I was there the day that she walked into the Ball household," says Wood. "We both stood there and our jaws dropped."She said it was Trevor\'s tight, bright yellow tennis shorts that did it for her."He got married wearing a pink jacket, which would have been trendy back then. "He had a mini cricket bat in the pocket. He reached inside during his speech and told everyone that he had his bat with him."Bayliss would have an eight-year first-class career with New South Wales, but his coaching teeth were not cut in the sunshine of Sydney. His first taste of a job that would lead to international recognition came in Glasgow.As part of a two-year spell as the overseas player at West of Scotland CC, Bayliss was asked to coach at the High School of Glasgow by West captain Colin Mair."He was only in his mid-20s and his first coaching role was working at the school in the summer of 1989," says Mair."When he finished playing, the first professional coaching job he got was a development role with New South Wales. I was one of the few people who had actually seen him coach, so I wrote him a reference."He loves Scotland and has stayed here a few times since he got the England job. Even before then, when he was here with Sri Lanka for the 2009 World Twenty20, I had him back coaching the kids at the school and the cricket club."By the time he took charge of Sri Lanka in 2007, Bayliss had been introduced to Paul Farbrace through a coaching exchange between New South Wales and Kent, suggested by former Australia captain Steve Waugh."I went to Sydney for a month and spent some time with Trev," says Farbrace, now the England assistant coach. "I went to his house one evening and Julie cooked for us. At the end of the week I came home and didn\'t hear from him again for 18 months."Out of the blue, I got a text from him asking if I would become his assistant in Sri Lanka."When I joined him out there, he met me at the Taj Hotel in Colombo. We had two-year contracts, but the first thing he said to me was, \'I\'m not sure I\'ll last two weeks here\'."About 18 months later, I asked why he picked me for the job. I\'d only spent a week with him in Sydney and we barely knew each other."He said \'I\'m not really sure. I suppose I thought that if I\'m spending two years away from my family, it might as well be with someone I get on with.\'"So it was nothing to do with my coaching skills? \'Nah,\' he said." Bayliss was in the running to be England coach in 2014, when Peter Moores was appointed.When  it began a reign where he has given away precious little about himself.Seldom seen without his trademark floppy hat and sunglasses - they have prescription lenses - his public image is a man of few words, fewer gestures and nothing approaching histrionics.If one of the hopes of speaking to those who know Bayliss best was to reveal a different side to his character, it has been dashed."Calm", "down to earth", "a man of few words" and "no frills" have been repeated again and again.That is not a criticism. It simply reiterates the point that, with Bayliss, what you see really is what you get."He\'s exactly how he appears to be," says England fast bowler James Anderson. "He doesn\'t give much away. He\'s not the most talkative guy in the world and, because he\'s like that, when he speaks, people listen."He\'s different to anyone I\'ve been coached by before. He\'s created a really relaxed environment and that\'s important because, when you\'re in the dressing room, you don\'t want any added pressure."The hands-off approach, a contrasting style to that of predecessors Moores and Andy Flower, was initially welcomed, especially when the However, though England\'s white-ball teams have been on a steady upward curve of improvement, the stagnation of the Test side has led to some questions of Bayliss\' methods.Overall, the Australian\'s record in 33 Tests at the helm is 15 wins and 14 losses, with four draws. You could make a convincing case that a side including Alastair Cook, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Stuart Broad and Anderson should be producing better results.Familiar problems remain. Holes at two, three and five in the batting line-up are no closer to being filled and too many catches are dropped. Are England able to take wickets when the bowlers have little or no assistance to work with? How far away is the next batting collapse?How successful is the selection policy? Of the 13 players given a Test debut by Bayliss, only Toby Roland-Jones has come close to establishing himself in the Test side, with Bayliss regularly admitting that he has not seen hopefuls play in the County Championship.After a 340-run loss to South Africa at Trent Bridge last summer,  "It does rather beg the question: what does he do? If he\'s just creating a relaxed environment, he could be replaced by a couple of scented candles, a yucca plant and a CD of ambient whale noises."Bayliss read that to Farbrace over breakfast the following morning."He thought it was a good line," says Farbrace. "He found it quite funny."No one should be fooled by the fact that he appears to sit and do nothing. That\'s not how he operates. He does his best work one-to-one and can speak clearly to the team when he needs to."He does sit back and let people do their jobs. What people outside don\'t see is that he does know what\'s going on."And so to Australia, where Bayliss returns home with his country\'s oldest cricketing enemy, attempting to defend the most storied prize in the game.Even before England travelled without Stokes, their task looked a stiff one. In their past 35 Tests down under, England have lost 24 and won only six.Although they are on track to perform well in the home World Cup of 2019, England teams are usually judged on their Ashes performances. Nothing prompts introspection and sweeping change quite like a miserable tour of Australia.In his own backyard, Bayliss will be scrutinised like never before. Still, according to those closest to him, Bayliss will not alter. "Water off a duck\'s back," according to Anderson.This past summer, Bayliss was joined in England by his son Adam, who played club cricket for Stratford-upon-Avon.On his days off, Bayliss Sr was often seen wandering around the boundary, following the all-rounder\'s progress."He came to watch eight or nine games," says Stratford captain Mike Brown. "If he was available, he\'d follow us home and away."We were keen not to hassle him, to just make him feel like any other parent. These, after all, were his days off."Because of that, I didn\'t really go to him for advice, but one day, after we had a pretty hefty defeat, he put his hand on my shoulder and said, \'As I say to our lads, at least you\'ll still be alive in the morning\'."It is advice Bayliss may need in the weeks to come.']	 CATEGORY:Sports

In 38 matches under Bayliss, they have lost 18 and won 15. The tour of Australia extended their winless run in away Tests to 11 matches.England\'s next assignment in Test cricket is two matches in New Zealand in March.The squad for that trip will be announced on Wednesday at 22:00 GMT - 24 hours later than planned as captain Joe Root recovers from the severe dehydration he suffered during the final Ashes Test.Australia coach Darren Lehmann  after the 2019 Ashes in the UK.In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, Bayliss also said:\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        Of the inexperienced members of England\'s batting line-up in Australia, Dawid Malan scored a maiden Test century and ended the series as England\'s leading runscorer.Stoneman and Vince both made two half-centuries but ended with averages in the mid-20s. Stoneman did not pass 24 in his final four innings, while Vince was often dismissed in the same manner - an edge to the wicketkeeper or slips."The way Stoneman and Vince played, they do deserve a bit more of a chance," said Bayliss. "They were playing against one of the best attacks in the world in their home conditions and showed the potential they have."They are aware that it\'s about performance and scoring enough runs. If, over a period of time, that doesn\'t happen and you have to look for someone else, that is the way of the game."As for the rest of the side that could line up for the first Test in Auckland, Bayliss does not expect it to be dissimilar from the one beaten by an innings in the final Ashes Test.England are still awaiting news on Ben Stokes after the all-rounder was arrested for an altercation outside a Bristol nightclub in September.Pace bowlers Craig Overton, Mark Wood, Chris Woakes and Toby Roland-Jones are all looking to return to fitness, while leg-spinner Mason Crane is set to travel after making his debut in Sydney.Batsman Gary Ballance, who did not play a Test on the Ashes tour, could miss out, with players such as Liam Livingstone, Joe Clarke or Dan Lawrence potential candidates for a first senior tour."I can\'t see any big changes," said Bayliss. "We\'ve known for a couple of years that we have been three or four performing players short of a very, very good team."Probably five or six positions in the squad will be discussed."\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        In Australia, England were not only hampered by the absence of Stokes but, in the early part of the tour, had to deal with several off-field issues.Wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow was accused of \'headbutting\' Australia\'s Cameron Bancroft, while Lions batsman Ben Duckett poured a drink over senior bowler James Anderson. Both incidents occurred in the same Perth bar.When news of Duckett\'s indiscretion emerged during a tour match in Perth, an irate Bayliss suggested some players would start paying with their place in the side if behaviour did not change.He has since seen an improvement, but still believes the furore around the off-field problems created one of the most difficult tours of his career."Some of the off-field stuff at the start of the tour was as tough as I\'ve experienced," said the former Sri Lanka coach."You could do without it, but I think the penny has finally dropped with the boys that we are in a different environment nowadays. Going forward I don\'t foresee any problems there. "It certainly made it a challenge earlier in the tour, but you look back now and, apart from that and the result, it\'s been an enjoyable Ashes contest. Sometimes, even on the losing side, it\'s enjoyable to be involved in."England\'s winless run away from home is part of a longer-term problem, with just one victorious series abroad since 2012.In the same time period, they have been beaten only once in the UK.In order to reverse their travelling fortunes, perhaps by nurturing a spinner or bowler of high pace, Bayliss says England might have to gamble with their home form."That could be a risk," he said. "If that was to occur and we\'re not as successful as we\'d like to be because we\'re blooding some young players, we have to take that on the chin and hopefully everyone realises that we\'re heading in a certain direction."Hopefully if you have those guys around the squad, they force their way in. That would be the best scenario. "One of things you get from new players in a squad is a youthful intensity that can up the interest of everyone."It might be, home or away, you chop and change a little bit. You might blood a young fast bowler somewhere like South Africa, or a young spinner in the subcontinent."']	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ['Perhaps former England spinner Graeme Swann has a point. Has Test cricket become too predictable?Take England as an example. Their win-loss record at home since 2012 is 23-11 in their favour. Away from home it plummets to 23-7 in the opposition\'s favour.They have not lost an Ashes series at home since 2001. They have won outright only once in Australia since 1986-87.After England fell to a  in their latest venture down under - coming on the back of a  - Test Match Special\'s Ed Smith surmised: "I don\'t think this series leaves you with much optimism about this format. I am concerned about how predictable a lot of the cricket has been."So has Test cricket\'s \'predictability\' made it boring? And is cricket the hardest sport in which to win away from home?While it is true that home teams hold the advantage in Test cricket - for a variety of reasons analysed below - it\'s not a new phenomenon.The percentage of Test wins earned by visiting sides has not changed drastically over the years.It has stayed between 20% and 30% for the past 100 or so years. If anything, away teams are winning more - victories for the touring sides in the 2010s is 27% compared to 23% in the 90s.Take away the anomaly of just 6.8% of wins for the away side in the calendar year of 2013 and that figure rises even higher - to above 30%.There are many, but one of the most obvious is to do with pitches.Put simply, the pitches in each of the 10 Test-playing nations offer a different challenge for both batsmen and bowlers.In Australia and South Africa, the ball bounces more than it does anywhere else. Hence fast bowlers are king.In England, New Zealand and, perhaps surprisingly, India the ball swings away from the batsmen more - meaning bowlers of obvious skill are more desirable than out-and-out pacemen.In Asia and, in recent years, the West Indies, the ball grips and spins off the dry surface more. This magnifies the need for a top-class turner of the ball and batsmen with the skills to overcome that challenge.Former England batsman Graham Thorpe had success in all conditions and is now coaching the national team\'s one-day players, who have risen to fourth in the world rankings."Learning to adapt is one of the biggest things, and understanding what tweaks you have to make in different countries," said Thorpe, who  in England, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and West Indies."Sometimes, it\'s even just about looking at how the opposition batsmen score their runs. You\'ll notice that Australian and South African players play the cut and pull shot well because they are used to dealing with the ball which bounces more."In Asia, it\'s about how well you use your feet against spin bowlers and how well you gather your runs."If playing on the world\'s different surfaces isn\'t challenging enough, a different ball manufacturer is used in Australia.In England, Tests are played with a Duke ball, while a Kookaburra is used in Australia. Statistics seem to back up the widely held view that the Duke is more bowler-friendly.When the English-produced Duke was used in domestic cricket in Australia, the average number of runs scored per wicket taken dropped from 34.6 to 28.9. The number of centuries scored per game also came down."Certain balls do perform better in certain conditions," said Australian Glenn McGrath, who has taken more Test wickets than any other fast bowler."I loved bowling with the Duke cricket ball - it felt smaller in the hand, had a bigger seam and would reverse swing a lot better. It was also harder than a Kookaburra so there were so many positives for the bowler." However, McGrath added: "You have to adapt to different conditions around the world. I have no issues with having to adapt to different balls."It is also fair to say host nations are not as hospitable to visitors as they once were.Tours are shorter, warm-up matches are fewer and the opposition provided by the hosts for such matches is often extremely weak.Imagine the England football team preparing for a World Cup by allowing their group-stage opponents to pick their opposition.Throw in the fact many nations - with the possible exception of Australia - produce pitches which suit their team, and it becomes an uphill task for touring teams.How can you pass a tough exam without any serious revision?"We have to draw a line under this tit-for-tat, zero-quality preparation that touring teams are given these days, which is totally against the interests of Test cricket," says BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew."Hopefully this has reached the depths and administrators have to realise they must give teams proper practice and preparation, otherwise touring sides are going to keep getting hammered."There\'s a pattern developing - there\'s no chance to restore confidence, no chance to restore form, no chance to get players who aren\'t playing in a Test match into any sort of condition or form. That\'s got to stop. This practice has to end."We\'ve established England struggle in Australia and India, while India struggle in Australia and England. Such narratives play out across Test cricket.So why isn\'t anything being done about it? After all, this is not a new trend."We obviously have to believe that the next time we come to Australia we can win," said assistant coach Paul Farbrace after England\'s latest Ashes loss."That means the planning has to start now. As much as we talk about conditions, we know we haven\'t played well enough. If you don\'t score first-innings runs, you struggle to stay in games."Australia have had three quality seamers and a good spinner, which has enabled them to keep the pressure on our batsmen."Adding weight to Farbrace\'s theory is the statistic that England averaged 354 in their first innings on this tour, compared to 445 when they last won in Australia in 2010-11.Thorpe added: "Cricket does have challenges which are unique but the strongest teams in the history of the game have enough in their armoury - like quality quick bowlers - to go and blow opposition sides away when they are touring."The key then? Score big runs and bowl fast - something Australia managed all summer down under as Steve Smith plundered almost 700 runs on his own and his three seamers - Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins, all capable of bowling in excess of 90mph - shared 66 wickets.England, by comparison, failed to take 20 wickets in a single Test during the series. They also failed to reach 500 in any innings.There\'s some justification for saying that cricket is one of the hardest sports for away teams when you take into account the different pitches, balls and climates which players encounter.It\'s also difficult from a more human perspective - England flew out to Australia on 28 October. Their final game on tour - including a Test series in New Zealand - ends in April.Logic would suggest visiting teams would improve as they got used to the conditions, but that hasn\'t happened for England on their past two tours of Australia, where they have lost nine out of 10 Tests.This bucks a trend researchers found in America, where the home team won 60% of matches at the start of World Series contests between 1924 and 1982. By the end of the series, that figure had dropped to 40%. Similar figures apply in the NBA during a similar period: 70% and 46%.Rather like trying to compare players across generations, it is difficult to offer a definitive answer to the question of whether cricket is the hardest sport to win away in. which looked at 5,000 matches involving 50 different referees between 1992 and 2006, researcher Ryan Boyko came up with the equation that for every extra 10,000 people in the crowd, the advantage for the home team increases by 0.1 goals.In a crowd of, say, 50,000, that can be significant. The same study also revealed that away teams scored fewer goals and gave away more penalties.However,  has shown there to be negligible advantage in basketball when comparing how a player performs when attempting a free throw, during NHL shootouts in ice hockey and conversion of penalty kicks in Germany\'s Bundesliga.As with many questions in sport, it probably comes down to personal opinion but there is no doubt it is hard for English cricket teams to win in places like Australia and India.But not, it should be said, impossible.']	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ['West Indies legend Michael Holding says England are scared of producing pace bowlers and that their lack of them was the problem in the Ashes defeat.England  against Australia.Holding says English pace bowlers are "not encouraged to go fast" and that economy rates are favoured over pace."If you\'re taking wickets, that\'s the important factor," said Holding. "But I have seen over the last 10 years or so, England don\'t seem to think that way."In the Ashes, Australia\'s Mitchell Starc averaged 89.1mph, just ahead of team-mates Josh Hazelwood (88.8mph) and Pat Cummins (88.1mph), with Chris Woakes the fastest of the England bowlers at an average of 85.6mph.Asked whether England are scared of producing pace bowlers, Holding told the  "Yes, definitely."That was the problem with England in the Ashes, they didn\'t have anyone with real pace," added former fast bowler Holding, who took 249 wickets in 60 Tests."England need people that can bowl 90mph and stay fit. England have found them in the past and there\'s no reason why they can\'t find them in the future."Holding cited Steven Finn as an example of an England bowler who has had his pace coached out of him.The 28-year-old was part of the England squad that flew out to Australia for the Ashes but  just nine days later with a knee injury.Finn, who has taken 125 wickets in 36 Tests, has not played a Test for England since October 2016."Fast bowlers in England are not encouraged to go fast, because when you are fast you are more liable to leak a few more runs per over than someone who is bowling medium pace and showing great control," said Holding."I heard so much about Steven Finn that he was going at four runs per over, and that was too many. But he was taking wickets. At one point, he was taking more wickets than the big names. "The economy rate does not matter, it\'s what\'s in the fourth column, the \'W\', that matters."Finn told BBC Sport his pace can drop, but said it is a result of a demanding schedule."The amount of teams and the amount of cricket we have doesn\'t particularly help fast bowlers being 100% fit to bowl fast all the time," he said."It takes an understanding from players and coaches to know that it\'s not possible to bowl 90mph every day for a whole county season, and I think that\'s how young people who do bowl fast could potentially lose their pace."In the past I\'ve played a whole summer and a whole year, and your pace does drop - I\'ve been a victim of that."It\'s my responsibility to understand when my body is at 100% and when its not."']	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ['Leading figures in world cricket have recommended the use of an extreme heat policy in the sport.England captain Joe Root was  during the final Test of the Ashes in Sydney, when temperatures reached 47.3C.The MCC\'s World Cricket committee, which met in Sydney, said umpires should be able to halt play for heat."There will be times where there are dangerous weather conditions, it would be silly to disregard that," it said.England officials said Root\'s condition in the final Test, when he was forced to retire because of illness as his team  was a viral gastroenteritis bug and not connected to the hottest day in Sydney Australia great Ricky Ponting, a member of the committee, said: "He probably had a viral thing too, but having one or two players go down seriously ill like that is a dangerous precedent just to ignore."I played in a game in Sharjah where it was 55 degrees air temperature and it did get dangerous."Former England captain Mike Gatting chaired the meeting of 14 ex-players, officials and administrators, who meet on behalf of cricket\'s lawmakers, the Marylebone Cricket Club, to discuss prevalent issues in the game.The existing law 2.7.1 empowers the umpires to suspend play if conditions are unreasonable or dangerous and after consultations with MCC\'s Laws sub-committee, it has been agreed that extremes of temperature fall within that remit.The committee noted Cricket Australia already has extreme heat guidelines in place, which uses the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature index to measure the discomfort level based on weather conditions, and suggested such an index could be used by other bodies, including the International Cricket Council, to protect players, officials and spectators.Other subjects under discussion included urging India\'s cricket board the BCCI to unite with the rest of the world game and lobby the International Olympic Committee for the inclusion of Twenty20 in the Olympic Games.In addition it was recommended that stem guards - which attach to helmets to provide extra protection at the back of the head and neck - should be made mandatory throughout the professional game.They have increased in popularity since the  who was struck on the top of the neck by a ball during a domestic match in Sydney in 2014.Find out how to get into cricket with our ']	 CATEGORY:Sports 

CONTENT:  ['And so it begins again.Like so many times in the past three decades, England have been trounced in Australia.After each chastening defeat - there have now been seven in eight series - we ponder how it might be different on the next tour.On this occasion, there can be no shrugging of shoulders that England were outclassed by legends like Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath, or that a disintegrating team were blown away by Mitchell Johnson.To be successful in 2021-22, England must acknowledge their shortcomings and implement change.Captain Joe Root has said that the planning starts now. It may look something like this...How many times during this tour have he heard England say that they have competed, or that there has not been too much difference between the sides? Even after defeat in the final Test in Sydney, seamer James Anderson said he felt the series was "Rubbish," said former England captain Michael Vaughan. "If England really believe they have got close to Australia, they\'re kidding themselves. They are miles away from winning here."Of the matches Australia won, two were by an innings, another by 10 wickets and the fourth when they opted not to enforce the follow-on.When Australia batted, they averaged 51.41 per wicket. England managed only 29.15. With the ball, Australia took 89 wickets, England just 58. It has been a shellacking.It is not an exception, either. Not only do England have a rotten record in Australia dating back to 1987, but their recent overseas results have been woeful; only one series win since 2012, no victory in their past 11 Tests.The travel sickness has been set against a backdrop of home success - only once have England been beaten at home since 2012, often in conditions where the ball moves and their skilful fast-medium bowlers befuddle visiting batsmen.In simple terms, England are brilliant at home, but awful when they have to dig out their passports."England have skilfully reduced expectations," said former spinner Graeme Swann. "We can\'t just say \'the boys have tried hard and we did our best\'. That\'s not good enough. "We need to be honest and ask why aren\'t we winning overseas?"England need to find a way of winning. It\'s not as though pitches are being doctored to be unfair to touring sides. It\'s up to teams to not be satisfied with just winning at home, but to put an emphasis on winning away."Taking the squad that won in 2010-11 as a template for success, only seven players survived from the 5-0 whitewash four years previous.In the intervening period, Swann, Stuart Broad, Matt Prior and Jonathan Trott established themselves in the Test side.It is not an exact science, though. At the same time, Tim Ambrose, Amjad Khan and Darren Pattinson were all tried and discarded.When looking for the pace, spin and runs that are needed to bring success in 2021-22, England must also face up to the reality of potentially losing all-time greats Anderson, Alastair Cook and Stuart Broad, who are all nearer the end of their careers than the beginning.England face a dilemma. Can they afford to wait for these stalwarts to call time, or do they try to integrate new faces while the experienced heads are still around?"Someone might get thrown into Test cricket before they are ready, but that means they can learn at the highest level," said Vaughan."Don\'t leave it until Broad and Anderson have left and then bring in a couple of young seamers."Coach Trevor Bayliss, who  says that plan is a possibility, but supporters must understand the potential consequences."That could be a risk," he said. "If that was to occur and we\'re not as successful as we\'d like because we\'re blooding some young players, we have to take that on the chin. Hopefully everyone realises we\'re heading in a certain direction."Once England have found the players they think are best suited for the next Ashes tour, the challenge is to give them experience of foreign conditions.Bayliss identified this as a key area of improvement following Australia\'s Ashes-clinching win in Perth, even going so far to suggest he would discuss with Cricket Australia if it can be more accommodating to English players, especially when so many Australian finish their education in county cricket.Of the teams that took to the field in Sydney, eight Australians had played in the County Championship in England, while Mason Crane was the only Englishman to have  - and only one game at that.England\'s busy schedule prevents winters down under, so any time spent in Australia is likely to end up benefitting much younger players.Perhaps the answer is for England to recreate Australian conditions to the best of their ability on home soil."It\'s very hard for players to get experience of playing four-day cricket in Australia, but you can take the conditions to where you are," said Vaughan, who led England to their 2005 Ashes triumph."That\'s what England have to do - find ways of preparing high-quality wickets in the UK and perhaps use the Kookaburra ball in some domestic cricket."Make them flat, so you spend days in the field when the ball doesn\'t do anything. That\'s where you need extra pace or quality spin and the batsmen have to go big."Bayliss says winning the Ashes away from home is the "highlight" of a player\'s career, but England still have important assignments to complete at home. India visit for five Tests this summer and the first opportunity to win back the Ashes comes in the UK in 2019.So there is a balance to be struck. Yes, England want to prepare well for their travels, but without giving up too much home advantage.The quandary of developing an England team that can thrive in all conditions, as well as staying committed to winning at home and being successful in white-ball cricket - there\'s a home World Cup to think about too in 2019 - was called the "million-dollar question" by Bayliss."You should still try to win at home, then hopefully you produce players who are good enough to help you win away," said Swann. "I panic about putting more priority on winning in four years, rather than focusing on the here and now, or the next Ashes."If we start losing at home again, we really are screwed." England have stressed that their planning and preparation for this Ashes tour has been meticulous.However, if we look at the successful campaign of 2010-11, there is a huge difference between what England did before that series and this.Swann said England treated their warm-up matches seven years ago as a "mini-Ashes", winning two and drawing one of three matches, all of which were first-class fixtures.This time around, England played a two-day match and two first-class games against mediocre opposition.Admittedly, the strength of the teams they face is beyond the tourists\' control - another thing Bayliss said he would discuss with Cricket Australia - but England managed to take only one wicket on the final day of the last warm-up game against a CA XI in Townsville."That lead-in is not ideal," said former Australia batsman Simon Katich, who was on the losing side in 2010-11."When England won, they played tough warm-up games and got great experience. This time, they played a lot of young kids in the CA XI games."It\'s not anywhere near the same level competition that you will face in the Tests."Root may have been joking when he responded to the question of what he could have done differently on this tour, his first as captain."I\'d have made sure no-one was headbutting anyone," he said.The skipper was alluding to the off-field problems that have blighted England\'s trip.Ben Stokes\' part in an altercation outside a Bristol nightclub in September robbed England of their talisman, while Jonny Bairstow\'s \'headbutt\' on Cameron Bancroft not only created more unwanted headlines, but gave the Australians ammunition on the field.\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n                        When Ben Duckett  an irate Bayliss was once again forced to ask questions on the behaviour of his team, while Moeen Ali, a devout Muslim, was asked if he was going to stay out of the pub for a few days.When Australia are winning and the opposition are shooting themselves in the foot, the home media can dish out brutal treatment to a touring team.On the only recent occasion when England turned the tide, they got the press to turn with them."In 2010-11, we were on the verge of being annihilated in the first Test in Brisbane and we managed to draw the game," said Swann."The Australian press turned on their team quicker than I\'ve ever seen the English media turn. By the end, we felt like we had them on our side."You should tell the England players that, if they are not winning and they are stupid enough to get caught doing something, they are going to get sent home."If England have the right players, have experienced the conditions and prepared in the right manner, the final piece of the jigsaw is to get the better of Australia over five Tests in perhaps the most hostile cricketing environment on the planet.Taking aside Australia\'s tendency to produce fast bowlers who like nothing more than to use Englishmen for target practice, touring teams have to deal with the baying, raucous and partisan crowds of the Gabba and the MCG.In Swann\'s opinion, it is an area where England have fallen short on this latest failed tour."It is tougher to play here than anywhere else," he said. "It feels like 23 million against 11."The Australian national psyche is for you to be subservient, for you to lie down and be easy to walk all over."You have to go toe to toe with them. It\'s not going to be every individual who can do that, but your leaders need to be like that."There are too many shadow-lurkers in the current team who just want to play their cricket without being the centre of attention. They want to do well, but they don\'t want to be man of the match."Michael Vaughan stood toe to toe with them and I\'m sure they respected him for the way he played.
